[A] Okay , uh ,
[A] let 's see ,
[A] I , I believe in the trial by jury .
[A] I think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for , uh , payoffs , you know , briberies , uh , unfairness , one-sidedness , you know , all those kinds of things .
[A] And I also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent , absolutely sure before you convict somebody .
[A] I , I really agree with the , uh , innocent until proven guilty theory .
[A] I think that 's , that 's a good way to do it .
[A] That 's about all .
[B] Well , I think , I think basically we 're in a lot of agreement , uh , in that I certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs , uh , some kind of legal definition .
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But for anything involving that , trial by jury certainly should be mandatory .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But there should be with our overworked , uh , judicial system ,
-----
[B] it seems to me like there ought to be a means of , of , um , not having to take everything before a full court . You know ,
[B] maybe there ought to be some kind of , of , uh , MUMBLEx
[B] is n't there a type of word called a jury duty now .
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] Really .
[B] And maybe instead of , of , uh , just kind of blowing it off just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do , maybe we should commit to spend a week ,
[B] and during that week you 're kind of an ad hoc , let 's hear about it , group of , I do n't know , twenty-five instead of twelve --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and each case is presented to that group of twenty-five ,
[B] and those cases are , uh , lesser degrees of magnitude . You know ,
[B] the guy was caught burgling ,
[B] and he had his pockets full of stuff , you know , when he was caught --
[A] Right .
-----
[B] -- you know , that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say , your pleasure your honor ,
[B] and there 's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing .
[A] Yeah .
[B] But the way our system , our court system works , that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time .
[A] Right .
[B] I just think our system is overworked ,
[B] and we 're starting to stretch the true meaning of , of right to a speedy trial .
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] that 's , that 's a good idea .
[A] Maybe this pre group of people could decide , you know , which kind of , uh , you know , where they could go from there .
[A] Do they need a big lengthy twelve person ju- , jury
[A] or do they need a six person jury or , you know , those kinds of things
[A] and the degree of the , of the , you know , the seriousness of it , you know ,
[A] how ,
[A] is this open and shut , you know , like you were saying ,
[A] or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened . You know , a jury like that .
[B] You know , we ,
-----
[A] They could be a good idea to ,
[A] that could work .
[B] You know , kind of MUMBLEx off what we 've been talking about here , uh , I believe that our , we 've become almost a litigious society where we , everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff ,
[B] and --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- although we supporting a whole segment of society called lawyers , maybe we do n't need to do that .
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] You know , maybe , instead of being so quick to sue you , uh , if you have a disagreement with someone , instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff , maybe you nee , maybe you ,
[B] and if you want to , your lawyer or your , your opponent need to go face this group of twenty-five or a judge MUMBLEx like --
[A] Good idea .
[B] -- they have on T V --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case .
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] right
[A] that 's ,
[B] And let 's , you know , let 's get rid of some of this harassment suing .
[A] Right ,
[A] that 's , that 's a good idea .
[A] I ,
[A] in the BIBLE it says , uh , if you have something against somebody , to go to them first ,
[A] and if that does n't work , then to go get somebody , you know , a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them ,
[A] and if that does n't work , to take it to the whole church .
[A] So that 's right off that same kind of principle .
[B] You bet ,
-----
[B] and if ,
[A] That 's a , that 's a good idea .
[B] If we could all deal with those kinds of beliefs we would n't have half the ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's true ,
[A] that 's true , too .
[A] But , uh , you know , that whole Biblical concept like that , that 's true in a lot of our ,
[A] um , you know , the , the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that .
[A] It does n't work on that ,
[A] but it 's based out of that .
[A] And , uh , so that , you know , that could work ,
[B] Yes ,
-----
[B] I 'd forgotten what that 's called .
[B] There 's a , a real name for that like the Judean law , or something like that .
[A] Um , what is that called ?
[A] The Judeo-Christian ethic .
[A] Judeo-Christian ethic .
[B] Well , that may be right .
[B] It 's in there some place .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I think we both know that we 're talking about --
[A] Right .
[B] -- the foundation of our legal society .
[A] Right ,
[A] right .
[B] Uh , and , too , the ,
[B] that was sort of the beginning of , Ye shall be treated fairly .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Uh , I guess the Lord started out with , we 'll treat you fa- , I 'll treat you fairly there as long as you do what I say .
[B] Uh , that 's sort of the Old Testament version .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's , that 's ,
[B] I know ,
[B] I did a Sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament --
[A] Really .
[B] -- where , where there 's a vengeful Lord in the Old Testament and there 's a loving Lord in the New Testament .
[B] But that 's a whole different subject .
[A] Really ,
[A] really ,
[A] yeah .
[B] Okay ,
[B] well , I , I think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge --
[A] Mine , too .
[B] -- on , on the legal system .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] mine , too .
[B] But it 's been a pleasure talking with you .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] same here .
[A] What , what part of the country are you from ?
[B] I 'm living here in Texas .
[A] Oh , okay ,
[A] in , in Texas .
[A] Okay ,
[A] I was just being curious .
[A] Okay .
[B] Well , that 's quite all right .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well , I 'm from the Dallas area .
[B] Well , so am I .
[A] Oh , okay ,
[A] well , that 's , that 's neat .
[B] In fact , I 'm at work out at Lewisville .
[A] Oh , are you really ?
[A] Wow .
[A] Okay ,
[A] well , I 'll let you go .
[A] And it was nice talking to you .
[B] My pleasure .
[B] Have a good day .
[A] You too .
[B] Bye-bye .
[A] Bye .
