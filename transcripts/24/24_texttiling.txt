[B] Okay .
[A] Okay .
[B] Well what do you think about the idea of , uh , kids having to do public service work for a year ?
[B] Do you think it 's a ,
[A] Well , I , I think it 's a pretty good idea .
[A] I think they should either do that , or , or afford some time to the military , or , or helping elderly people .
[B] Yes ,
[B] yes ,
[B] def- ,
[A] I , I , you know , I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help
[A] and I think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and , and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home
[A] and --
[B] That 's true .
-----
[A] -- I 'm not sure that that 's not a bad idea
[A] and , or the military for a year or two ,
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] would n't be bad for ,
[A] I think it teaches kids how to grow .
[A] How about yourself ?
[B] Uh , I agree with you .
[B] Uh , uh , what I 'm thinking about is back , well , when I was a kid , and much earlier than that , kids were kind of , i- , i- ,
[B] you know , the parents kind of pushed them to join , like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts
[B] and they did , do , do do a lot of public service activities ,
[B] but these days they 're not , uh ,
[B] par- , parents are n't encouraging their kids to do things like that .
[B] Because when I was in the Girl Scouts , we did a lot of public service things , because that 's just part o- , of , of the scouting , and , you know .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I 've , I 've ,
[A] that 's really great .
[A] I , I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent , two excellent organizations .
[B] They are
-----
[B] but parents ,
[A] You know , kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] they do .
[A] and they do n't follow it at all , you know .
[A] There are very few Scouts go on ,
[B] Oh , no .
[A] and become Eagle Scouts .
[A] And , and I do n't know what the high rank is for the gals
[A] but ,
[B] I , I , uh ,
[B] senior .
[A] Oh .
[A] Senior ,
[A] okay .
[A] So , there 's not , uh ,
[B] Oh , they 're just not ,
[B] once they get into junior high it just ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] they , they lose interest .
[B] not done anymore .
[A] and then when they young , young adults ,
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] there 's even less interest there .
[A] They 're more for , I g ,
[B] Me .
[A] Not , not ,
[A] yeah .
[B] Grab ,
[B] grab ,
[B] grab ,
[B] walk out .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] you 're absolutely right .
[B] Yeah
[A] I think it 's a really a good thing .
[A] I , I like to see ,
[A] of course , there 's , you know , third world countries that can use all kind of help .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] but there 's a lot that can be done right here in this country ,
[A] But I think ,
[B] too .
[A] we ought to start right here at home .
[A] I 'm , you know ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] uh , I 'm not , I 'm not so sure that overseas help , helping overseas would be such a hot idea for , for , uh , a lot of young k- , people .
[A] No ,
[A] it , it ,
[B] But , since there is much that needs to be done here .
[A] I think that , yeah , I think that we need to really address what we 've done here
[A] and , and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Well , it 's been really good .
[A] We talked about this for a few minutes ,
[A] and , uh , hopefully , we 'll have other good topic maybe another call someday ,
[A] but I , I do n't really have too much more to say on this topic , I guess .
[B] No ,
[B] I , I agree with you .
[A] It , we , I guess we both agree that it 's a good thing ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] that they should do sometime .
[B] Okay .
[A] Well you take care ,
[A] and , and ,
[B] You , too .
[A] enjoy the day .
[B] You , too .
[A] Thank you , ma'am .
[A] Bye-bye .
[B] Bye-bye .
