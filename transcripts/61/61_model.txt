[A] Hi .
-----
[B] Hi , uh ,
[B] as a matter of fact this past weekend , since we had a long weekend , I , uh , took on a painting project in my bathroom
[B] and I had wallpaper up ,
[B] I had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that
[B] and it took me all weekend
[B] because , uh , the wallpaper , getting it off , I had to wet the walls down
[B] and that had to dry .
[B] And then the spackling had to dry a day
[B] and then the painting took another day .
[A] You did n't try re , rewallpapering ?
-----
[A] You just , uh ,
[B] No .
[B] I , I just painted .
[A] Did you use a textured paint
-----
[A] or ,
[B] Uh , no .
[B] Actually , the wall behind the paper was smooth
[B] so , I just used a , like a semigloss .
[A] Um .
[B] And ,
[A] Well , did you get good results ?
[B] Well , no ,
-----
[B] not really .
[B] I need to ,
[B] it , it looks so ,
[B] bad you can see where those spackling marks were .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I need to , uh , either paper back over it or do something .
[A] But it just did n't , it did n't , it did n't cover it ?
[B] Yeah .
[B] It covered the spots pretty good
[B] but it did n't , excuse me , it did n't , uh , uh , it just did n't look as smooth as I wanted it to .
-----
[A] Well , we did a , uh ,
[A] we moved , oh , last August
[A] and we 're getting a house ,
[A] my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den
[A] and we decided ,
[A] we went to , I 've forgotten , one of the paint stores
[A] and they just said , oh , you can get by ,
[A] and I forgotten what it was you put down , and then you can just paint right over the dark .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Well , more or less .
[A] After about , uh , half dozen coats it looks reasonable
[A] but it kept ,
[A] the , the dark
[A] it was , uh , just a real dark , uh , wood grain type paneling --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and it was smooth
[A] and , uh , and we would , we put this stuff on
[A] and , and it supposedly textured it or did something to it
[A] and , but because of the b- , dark behind it , it was really hard to cover
[A] and ,
[B] Was it like a primer ?
[A] Yeah .
[A] It was something like that , although , we sort of , when we got through I wished we had n't done it
[A] because we were , you know , we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it
[A] and we were painting it and trying to do , uh , you know , make it ,
[A] and it , it really was , you know ,
[A] the advice they give you is , uh ,
-----
[A] the job was considerably tougher than we thought .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Uh , particularly when you try to ,
[A] I was talking to somebody else who , who had a lot of wood panelling
[A] and , uh , they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate
[A] and it seemed like there was , it was a good sized den with a lot panelling
[A] and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something .
[B] Oh , my goodness ,
[B] that 's an awful lot .
[A] Have you , have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted ?
[B] Not inside .
[B] Now , uh , when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it .
[B] That was one of the requirements from , you know , F H A --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- that the house be painted before we bought it
-----
[B] and it was fairly reasonable .
[B] We have a brick house
[B] but all the trim --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- around the house was , uh ,
[B] if I remember right , it was like five hundred dollars .
[A] Oh , that 's quite reasonable .
-----
[B] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[A] MUMBLEx .
[B] so that was n't too bad .
[A] Um , problem i ,
[A] have you , have you tried matching paint lately ?
-----
[B] No ,
[B] I have n't .
[A] My wife ,
[A] we , we built a shed over the long way ,
[A] actually , it took ,
[A] this is not on the topic
[A] but I did finish it .
[A] But my wife went to the , uh , Home Depot , I think it was , and , and took a , uh , a copy , took a piece of brick --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and she wanted to paint the shed
[A] it 's , it 's a wooden shed , uh ,
[A] and she took it
[A] and they 've got this machine that matches the color of paint .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , uh , they got ,
[A] and , uh , and , in fact she put some right ba- ,
[A] she got ,
[A] they mixed , uh , a gallon of it
[A] and , uh , it 's just remarkable how close it will match the paint , uh ,
[A] and it does it , uh , oh , electronically some , something ,
[B] Oh ,
[B] so ,
[A] magic .
[B] they did do a good job ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] you know , they ,
-----
[A] but it 's electronic .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Uh , you put your sample under this thing
[A] and it looks at it in- , and , uh , and determines the ,
[A] and it , it 's really remarkable .
[A] Uh , the problem they had
[A] and then they wanted some gray to do the , to do the trim .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , uh , but they did n't , did n't occur to them that , um , that they could have taken a sample --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- um , from ,
[A] I forgotten ,
[A] this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something
[A] but anyway . It 's , it 's remarkable .
[A] That 's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the , you know ,
[A] you want this , you want this to look like this
[A] and you want that to look like that
[A] and ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] of course , if it 's all white you 're all right
[A] but when you start getting into colors ,
[A] have you had problems getting colors to match ?
[B] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[B] As a matter of fact , uh , what we 've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a , uh , a blue
[B] and the blue , even so many years , two years later or so it does n't match ,
[A] Um .
[B] you know ,
-----
[A] So ,
[B] it 's the very same type of paint and everything ,
[A] Gosh .
[B] So ,
[A] So you ,
[A] so what 's your ,
[A] what 's the solution then ?
[B] Oh , I have no idea .
-----
[B] I repainted the whole thing .
[A] Oh , my .
[A] Well , at least you 'll get very good at it , right ?
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] You could go back and , and paint ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] the whole thing over
[A] that 's , uh , this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting
[A] because it , uh , it seems like everybody has a , you know , to go in and do ,
[A] I 'll just do a little bit here and a little there .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Although , the , uh ,
[A] it 's uh , it ,
[A] we almost one day ,
[A] we painted the house to , uh ,
[A] we painted , we painted the whole inside
[A] and it had all this dark trim .
[A] We thought , uh , you know ,
[A] we did the one wall but the other trim ,
[A] I 'm trying to think ,
[A] I think , I think we left most of it because it gets to be , uh ,
[A] they do n't do that in the newer houses now
[A] we do n't ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] the mold ,
[B] MUMBLEx .
[A] everything is white .
[A] In a new house everything is white .
[B] White ,
[B] yeah .
[B] That 's what we 're trying to get ours to look like .
[A] Oh , good luck .
[A] We wound up selling the house .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Actually , I , I do n't know whether it made ,
[A] actually it does ,
[A] it 's interesting that the white , um , makes the rooms look bigger .
[A] One of the ,
[A] in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room , it has molding , uh , like picture frames , I do n't know what you call that --
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- that actually , that are along the walls , you know , up a couple of feet .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And my wife painted those , the insides of those dark blue .
[B] Oh , I see .
-----
[A] And , uh , it makes the room look remarkably smaller .
[B] Huh . She painted the insides dark blue and then the trim ,
[A] The trim ,
[B] what color ?
-----
[A] is still white .
[B] Okay .
[A] The ,
[B] White .
[A] the molding --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- but by ,
[A] and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] but it makes the room look smaller which is , uh --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- uh , which is ,
[A] it explains why they , why they have everything white
[A] but I ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] you would n't think that I ,
[A] well , maybe ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff
[A] but ,
[B] Well , uh , what about the lighting ?
[B] Did it make a big difference ?
-----
[A] Uh , not particularly
[A] because the house has so many windows --
[B] Oh , uh-huh .
[A] -- uh , it has
-----
[A] the , the , the living room has four , uh , good size windows
[A] and , uh , well , of course , at night
[A] but with the ,
[A] we have , we have a soccer field --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- that 's , um , oh , about a hundred yards from our house
[A] and the lights shine right at our house .
[A] It 's kind of ,
[A] we did n't know that when we bought the house
[A] but ,
[B] So that , uh ,
[B] you get some ,
[B] the color does n't really matter for , because you have that light .
[A] Yeah .
[A] We have a lot of light ,
-----
[A] yeah .
[A] And , well , it , it , it , um , well , it 's just , uh , I think it 's just the , the , the dark blue to about three feet
[A] and then above that we left it white
[A] so . Anyway , it did n't ,
[B] I see .
-----
[A] it did n't change
[A] but the , the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away
[A] it did n't ,
[A] it kind of bled under the masking tape which , I guess , is probably the topic we 're --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- we 're really on to that , that the masking is ,
[A] you have to do that very , very carefully .
[B] And it takes a long time ,
[A] That 's right .
-----
[A] You can work yourself to death .
[A] Well , I 'm sorry to hear your color did n't come out so good over the weekend .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Really ,
[B] no kidding .
[A] It 's kind of frustrating .
[B] It is .
-----
[B] A lot of work ,
[B] a lot of work .
[A] Well , I 've got to go to a meeting .
[A] It 's been good talking to you .
[B] Nice talking to you .
-----
[A] Okay .
[A] Good-bye .
[B] Bye .
