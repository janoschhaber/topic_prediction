[A] All right , um ,
-----
[A] I think the topic was crime in the city .
[B] Right .
[A] I do not live in a city .
[A] I live in a real small little place .
[B] Where is that ?
[A] Uh , it 's about thirty miles from Sherman .
-----
[B] North , south , east , or west ?
[A] It 's north of Sherman .
[B] Well , you live almost in Oklahoma .
[A] Not too far .
[B] Yeah .
[B] That 's kind of ironic , because I do n't live too far from Oklahoma either .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] You know where Saint Joe is ?
-----
[A] Uh , I 've been through there .
[B] I 'm about eight miles south of it .
[A] Okay .
[A] Oh , yeah .
[A] I had been through Saint Joe ,
[A] but , um , just as far as watching the news and reading the papers and all that , it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad .
-----
[B] Well , you know , I 've , I 've seen those statistics and everything ,
[B] and you know , what frightens me , is that , you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert --
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] -- with high tech weaponry , you know ,
[B] I mean , the Iraqis did n't have a lot of high-tech weaponry ,
[B] but they had mortars and machine guns ,
[A] Oh , yeah .
-----
[B] tanks and all that .
[A] Sure .
[B] And , they did n't kill as many people in , in forty-five days ,
[B] and they were intending to kill people ,
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] I mean , that was their job , as they killed in Washington D C .
[A] Oh , I know ,
[A] I know .
[A] I know .
[A] Um , I think nowadays people just , really just , murder is nothing to them , you know .
-----
[B] Well , I formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years , I guess .
[B] And , I 've come to the conclusion , and this is a pretty scary thought to me , even , that if a guy is convicted , or a gal is convicted , of a crime , rather than put them in prison , because prison 's proven not to work , just let them go .
[B] Say okay , you 're convicted --
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] -- and just let them go --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and if they get convicted again , well , just kill them .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] because , uh , most likely that will happen , wo n't it , that , you know ,
[B] Well , I think that the best hope to eliminate crime , as we know it today --
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] -- is to eliminate the criminals from society .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] If someone is known to have been in prison , they ca n't get a job .
[A] No .
[B] You know .
[A] Yeah .
[B] They ca n't be accepted into society .
[B] You know , if they 're not going to be accepted into society , then everybody 's going to become sociopathic .
-----
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] And , you know , who 's to put the limit on it ?
[B] I mean , I was watching a thing last night , up in Washington State .
[B] If you get convicted of , uh , sexual offenses , on a regular basis .
[B] You know , I mean , some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] And they 're still let out on the street after one or two years .
[B] Well , in Washington State , if you 're a habitual sexual offender , they just do n't let you out .
[A] Um .
[B] So you serve your prison term ,
[B] and then you go into the mental hospital ,
[B] and if you 're pronounced cured , they 'll let you go .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] Well , they may find a cure for it ,
[B] but there is no known cure now .
[A] Um . So you 're , you 're kind of thinking ,
-----
[A] in other words , if you get , if you do something the first time , that 's not real bad , you know ,
[B] Hey , people make mistakes .
[A] yeah ,
[A] to go ahead and let them go ,
-----
[A] but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then , uh .
[B] Well , yeah ,
[B] use that
[B] or , you know , there 's other consequences rather than killing them , you know ,
[B] you could ,
-----
[A] Oh .
[B] always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] You know .
[A] Yeah .
[B] At least they might get some benefit in that ,
[B] and if the people they committed a crime against , feel , at some later date , that these people have learned their lesson , are , are okay , you know , well , they can free them .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] But , uh , you know , with the technology we have today , you can put a collar on a guy 's leg that will knock him down if they leave the property .
[B] I mean , it will just in incapacitate them .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] And , you can put a collar around a guy 's leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] But , you know , putting them in prison , my God , that does n't work .
[A] No ,
[A] apparently not ,
[A] because look how many years they 've been doing that
-----
[A] and look ,
[A] I mean , yeah .
[B] Well , you look at places like Turkey .
[B] Turkey has the death penalty ,
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] for just about everything .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] I mean , if you get convicted of , uh , you know , drug trafficking , they just kill you .
[B] You get convicted of , uh , you know , heinous crimes , they just kill you .
[B] I mean there 's no two ways about it .
-----
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] And , uh , you look at their society
[B] and the repeat offenders are very few .
[B] You know , and you look at our society , almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison , has been in prison three or four times .
[A] Three or four times ,
[A] yeah .
[B] I mean ,
[A] That is true ,
-----
[A] I know .
[A] Yeah .
[B] You know , the way to stop that kind of behavior is , is two-fold .
[B] One , you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven .
[B] I , I think that 's very important .
[A] Oh , I 'm , I agree very much so on that ,
-----
[A] I ,
[A] yeah .
[B] And then , if a parent has proved to be unfit , for any reason --
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] -- take the kids away from the parents .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Because , you know , we are what we teach .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] Because that 's what our society becomes .
[B] We have ,
[A] comes ,
[A] yeah .
[B] We have just a bunch of people ,
[B] and I 've , and I 've , I 've lived in that , that environment for quite a few years when I was doing construction work .
[B] You know , and these guys , they come to work every morning
[B] and they 're stoned to the bone .
[B] I mean , they 're so high , they could fly up to the top of that building
[B] and they work all day ,
[B] and they go home
[B] and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs
[B] and when they run out of money , they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money ,
[B] and then they go back to work on Monday .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] And , the kids of these people MUMBLEx .
[A] Sure ,
[A] they just think that 's the normal thing to do , do n't they ...
-----
[B] They 're sociopathic .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And I worked in a first grade classroom for one full semester --
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] -- and these kids were more foulmouthed than I 've ever been .
[B] I had one kid threaten my life ,
[A] In the first grade .
-----
[B] Threaten my life .
[B] Told me that daddy 's going to whoop me to death .
[A] Oh , know .
[B] You know , and they flipping me the finger and all that --
-----
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] -- and I just said to this kid ,
[B] I said , you got two choices kid ,
[B] you can step into mainstream society
[B] or you can die .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] Because you will eventually be killed .
[B] And , I just , I 'm just totally aghast at a what 's going on .
[A] Oh , I know .
[A] I know , um ,
[A] I work in school . You know ,
[A] that 's something I do
-----
[A] and I , it really is
[A] I 'm like you
[A] astonishing what the younger ages know ,
[A] and they react to what they see at home . You know .
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] If they see violence at home , that 's what you 're going to get from the kids at school .
[B] Exactly .
[A] You know . It really is ,
[A] and that 's kind of sad .
[B] Well , you can see it in the work place , you know .
[B] Used to be when you had a personality conflict you just , you worked with it
[B] and you got through it .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] Now , you know , people get fired ,
-----
[B] or what 's even worse , is they promote them into a position that they ca n't handle and let them get fired .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Or , one thing or the other .
[B] You look at another kind of society like the Japanese .
[B] You put that many people on that small of a space , they 've learned to live together .
[B] Okay .
[B] It 's in their culture .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] And one of the things that 's in their culture that I really think the major corporations should pay attention to , is the fact that , while Japan was becoming a great power , financially , the people that worked for those companies , worked for the same company they worked for at sixty-five , as they did when they were eighteen .
[A] Teen .
[B] And the company , took it upon itself to find a position for these people .
[B] If they were n't fit for the job they were hired for , they did n't just can them ,
[B] they made a position for them some where .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] You look at Frito Lay .
[B] My wife used to work for Frito Lay as a typist .
[B] You know , transcribing stuff into the computer .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] Well , she could type about one-hundred and five words per minute ,
[B] but she do n't like it .
[B] She just does n't like to do that .
[B] I mean , she will .
[A] Yeah .
[B] But , you know , her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is ...
