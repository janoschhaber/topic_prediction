[A] Okay , um ,
[A] let 's see .
[A] How do you feel about credit cards ?
[B] Personally , I do not care for them . Uh , although I find them a necessity in business and so forth ,
[B] I , I try to refrain from their use as much as possible . Um , for a number of reasons , one of which is the , you know , extreme interest rate on most of them .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] The one I use , uh , of course , for mostly , only for business purposes is , uh , you know , American Express .
[A] Right .
-----
[B] And , uh , I 'm not I 'm not terribly in favor of them .
[B] Not for my own personal , uh , point of view .
[A] Right .
[B] Plus it , uh , has , you know , from an economic point of view it has increased our debt --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- tremendously --
[A] Right .
[B] -- to the tune of somewhere on the order of five to ten billion , I believe --
[A] Wow .
[B] -- uh , at least that 's one number for this range of numbers I have , I have heard .
[A] Right .
[B] Do you use them frequently
[B] or ,
[A] Well , we , uh , me and my wife , when , when we have like extra money that we know we 're going to have , and we can put it in our budget , yeah , we 'll , we 'll use it .
[A] But like last year , I think we paid ,
[A] I think it was like twenty something cents interest ,
[A] on our Visa .
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And I think this , this year we , uh , I think we used it for Christmas ,
[A] and we got caught just a few days on our grace period .
[A] And , uh , so we 'll pay a little interest this year , but maybe two dollars .
[A] But we do n't like to do that at all .
[B] Yes .
[A] And , you know , we , I think we feel about the same way you do real strongly .
[A] We , uh , we have several credit cards , though .
[A] We have a gas card , our Visa , and then , of course , the American Express ,
[A] and I think we have a couple of department stores .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] But , we use it the same way ,
[A] and , uh ,
[B] I find the one I use mostly , uh ,
[B] aside from the American Express , I do use my Sears card .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But , uh , I try , a- , as with the American Express , I try to pay it , you know , as it comes in .
[A] Right .
[A] Right .
[B] So , uh ,
[A] It 's , it 's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill .
[A] That 's usually how we do it .
[B] I know when I travel , or when I used to travel overseas quite a bit , what I would do on my American Express card is before I would , before I left I would mail a check to , to American Express --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and , you know , have some idea of how much was there , you know , I 'd sent them , you know , several hundred dollars , or whatever --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- I felt I would spend .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And then use it then .
[A] Yeah .
[B] But , uh , for hotels and , and so forth .
[B] But , uh , but I knew that it was paid .
[B] I knew --
[A] Right .
[B] -- I knew that I had that much --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- credit , going in .
[B] Sometimes , you know , sometimes I would go over ,
[B] but it would n't , you know , it would n't hit me in a big , in a big way because --
[A] Right .
[B] -- I knew that , uh , I would have it covered in that respect .
[A] Right .
[A] That 's good .
[A] I 've , I do n't think we 've gone that far MUMBLEx ,
[A] to pay it in ad- , you know , in advance before we spend it ,
[A] but , I guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it , that , like that ,
[B] Well , I found --
[A] that may be good .
[B] -- I found in , um , in traveling overseas --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- that , uh , often it would , uh , it would expedite things to have an American Express credit card --
[A] Oh really .
[B] -- for hotel bills and so forth .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Plus I would , uh , when they , uh , would send the bill , they would automatically convert to the exchange rate .
[A] Right ,
[A] right .
[B] So , now , the only time that got to be a problem was , if the exchange rate changed drastically .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Uh , for example , I remember on one trip to France when I started planning the trip , I think , uh , a dollar was worth nine or ten
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And whe , when I finally got over there , it had fallen , uh , two or three francs to the dollar .
[B] So the ,
[A] Wow .
[B] So , I got caught a little short --
[A] Wow .
[B] -- in that regard ,
[B] but , uh --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- uh , I , I was anticipating , you know , my room would cost , uh , let 's say
[B] if it were , say sixty or seventy francs a night --
[A] Right .
[B] -- that would mean it would be about ten dollars or so , or maybe twenty dolls- ,
[B] maybe it would be more than that .
[B] It was more than .
[B] It would average out to thirty-five or forty dollars a night --
[A] Right .
[B] -- which is a reasonable rate .
[A] Right .
[B] But then when I got back and I was working for the government at the time --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- of course the government was several months behind in ,
[A] Right ,
[A] yeah .
[B] their , on its per diem for exchange rate .
[A] Right .
[B] So there 's a little consternation , you know , in trying to get them to compensate ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] for the difference in the exchange rate .
[A] Right .
[A] Yeah
[A] especially ,
[B] That was the only time I really got caught short .
[B] And I ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] But as I said , most , most of all I try not to use them , uh , to any , you know , lavishly , in that regard .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well tha- , that 's good .
[B] Well , from where are you calling ?
[A] Oh , from the Dallas area .
[B] So you 're from Dal- ,
[B] okay ,
[B] I 'm from Maryland .
[A] Oh really .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Wow .
[A] Do you work for T I ?
[B] No .
[B] I work for G T E .
[A] Well , really .
[B] Yes .
[A] Um . I wonder how T I got G T E involved .
[B] Well , I know Jack Godfrey .
[A] Oh , okay .
[B] I know him very well .
[B] I 've known Jack for a long time ,
[B] and I 'm also in the speech business .
[A] Oh , okay .
[B] So , when I heard that Jack was going to do this , I called him and asked for an application where I could participate --
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[B] -- in this .
[B] And , so that 's how I got involved .
[A] Yeah .
[A] You have a very , um , very ,
[A] what 's the word .
[A] Your , your speech is very exact .
[B] Oh . Thank you very much .
[B] But , as Jack said , I 'm one of the , the old hands in the speech business .
[A] Oh really .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] uh . Yes ,
[B] I , I 've been doing it for twenty some odd years .
[A] Wow .
[B] And so , uh , I was very much interested , uh , in getting involved in , uh , switchboard .
[A] Yeah .
[B] So , uh , you work for T I ?
[A] Right .
[A] I work in MUMBLEx .
[B] Oh , really ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] I guess we 're supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording .
[A] Yeah .
[A] I think we talked for a good eight minutes about the subject ,
[A] so , I think you get ten ,
[A] so I think we 're okay .
[B] Alright .
[B] Okay ,
[B] fine .
[B] Well , you have a good evening .
