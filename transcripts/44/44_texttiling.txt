[A] Okay ,
[A] well , I can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows --
[B] Okay .
[A] -- and they kind of are in different spectrums , I think . Um ,
[A] one of them is QUANTUM LEAP --
[B] Okay .
[A] -- and the other one is NIGHT COURT .
[A] And I think , I think they 're real different , I mean ,
[A] I do n't think they have anything in common ,
[A] um , QUANTUM , LEAP has , I mean QUANTUM LEAP is kind of a comedy in its own way , I guess ,
-----
[A] but , uh , mostly it 's , it 's kind of science fiction ,
[A] and , it 's , um , it 's adventure and things like that --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and then NIGHT COURT is just pure , you know , weird fun , you know ,
[A] just , it 's , it 's nothing serious about it at all .
[A] So , I do n't know why the two of them happen ,
[A] to be my two favorite shows ,
[A] but they , that 's the way it is ,
[A] so .
[B] It 's funny that those are my two , my husband 's two favorite shows , too ,
[B] and I enjoy both , watching both of them ,
[B] but I used to did n't like NIGHT COURT --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and I ,
[B] and the only reason I think I like it now is because I 've seen it so much
[B] and I 'm involved with the characters ,
[B] but ,
[B] I used to think , um , Dan Fielding was just too , too vulgar and too crude for me .
[A] He is .
[B] And I told my husband , that 's the whole point ,
[B] but --
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's right ,
[A] I mean ,
[B] -- I , I just ,
[B] it 's ,
[B] I find him degrading at times .
[B] I guess that is the point ,
[B] but sometimes it just ,
[A] Well , they , they really have changed him though .
[A] If , If you 've watched it this season , um , he 's becoming , I mean , he still is in his own way degrading and everything ,
[A] but , uh , he 's involved in that charity ,
[A] and , uh , it 's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought , that he really has ,
[A] in fact , there was one show that he even turned down a date with some , you know , beautiful woman just because the idea that he was , his mind was on the ozone layer --
[B] Oh .
[A] -- and , you know , global warming and all this other kind of stuff .
[A] And he , you know , was too depressed , you know , to ,
[A] so that was part of , I guess , his character building or whatever ,
[A] but ,
[B] I think it adds a , probably adds a little bit of depth to his character .
[B] I have n't watched , um --
[A] Which of course he needed .
[B] -- yeah ,
[B] I think so ,
[B] which in QUANTUM LEAP you get
[B] even though the person is involved in so many other people 's lives , you still see a , a real person in those situations .
[B] He gets , um , he 's doing amazing things --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- but he 's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do --
[A] Right ,
[A] right ,
[A] that 's a good point ,
[B] -- and I think that 's ,
[B] I like that .
[A] So what do you , what do you consider your favorite shows ?
[B] Um , I think my favorite show is HUNTER .
[A] Okay .
[B] And , I , I like the old ser- , series better when , um --
[A] Dede ,
[B] -- Dede was in there .
[B] Yeah --
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I agree .
[B] -- and , um , so , uh , uh , and then the blond that they took out , the one that got killed --
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I ca n't remember what her name is ,
[A] but is ,
[B] -- yeah ,
[B] I did n't enjoy her .
[B] I , I ,
[B] she was too much of a opposite of Dede ,
[B] and I think that 's what they try to do ,
[B] but I think we wanted to see Dede there --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- or somebody like her .
[A] Well , but , see I read an article about , in T V GUIDE about , uh , about HUNTER , and about his , you know , latest , you know , his three girls , whatever you want to call them --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and they say that , uh , that there was abso- , that there was like a conflict between her and him , uh , that they never really could get her into , uh , any character that they could use .
[A] I mean , you know , uh --
[B] The second lady ?
[A] -- yeah ,
[A] the second one --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- the blond --
[B] Yeah ,
[A] -- you know , if you think about it , they did n't really interact hardly at all --
[B] They did n't .
[A] -- I mean , they were never partners .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] she would go her way ,
[B] and --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- he would do his ,
[B] and I think that 's what I did n't like .
[A] And , and , and even , even at the beginning Dede and , and Hunter would decide that one of them would go do this , while the other one would do , would go this ,
[A] but , uh , it seemed like it was almost two different organizations --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- you know ,
[A] like Hunter was the boss ,
[A] and this other girl was not ,
[A] and , you know , you kind of , you 're wondering , you know , well when did this happen ?
[B] Right .
[A] So , yeah ,
[A] I , I kind of agree with that .
[B] And I like the new lady better ,
[B] but I 'd just as soon that they did n't have the romance there .
[B] I 'd just as soon have the , the police story without all the romance .
[A] Well , I 'm afraid that 's what they , they really wanted to do , um ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I think most shows were doing that ,
[B] and then they went away from it --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and now they 're starting to go back to it ,
[B] and maybe that 's what the public wants ,
[B] I do n't know ,
[B] but I just , I like the , the cut and dry solve the mystery ,
[B] and that 's what I always enjoyed about it .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well , see , there was that spark between Dede and Hunter for a while --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- but they , they like started it ,
[A] and then they 'd pull it back ,
[A] and they 'd start it and pull it back .
[A] And that really made it a very interesting , uh , show to where you never really knew which , which one was going to show up . You know , whether it was going to , where they 're going to be real close or whether they 're just going to be partners , you know --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- And , that , that I kind of thought was good ,
[A] but , um , you know , it 's , I guess , you know ,
[A] you always kind of sit there
[A] and you see these two people together ,
[A] and you always wonder , why they do n't , you know , get together --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- or whatever .
[A] And so I guess that 's what they decide to do --
[B] Just go ahead and --
[A] -- Yeah .
[B] -- quit the wondering
[B] and , and ,
[A] But it 's , it 's always been a formula , uh , for T V that the minute that two people , that the two main stars get married , that the show ends up , you know , dying .
[B] Yeah .
[A] A , a , good example of this , and , you know , this is probabl- ,
[A] maybe it 's not a good example .
[A] I 've been watching Nickelodeon all last week , because they had what they called MAXIMUM SMART .
[A] They had GET SMART for , uh , ten hours a day , from seven o'clock at night , until six or until five o'clock the next morning .
[B] Oh .
[A] All the GET SMART episodes you could ever see .
[A] Well , the , the last day , all they did was the last season , to where the two of them got married --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and that was , I mean , that was the killer ,
[A] the series died right after that ,
[B] I did n't ,
[A] because ,
[A] well go ahead .
[B] I was going to say , I did n't ever watch MOONLIGHTING ,
[B] but I heard that 's what killed it --
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] same thing .
[B] -- that , uh , interplay died when they got married ,
[B] and so the show died .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] the ,
[A] it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they , they , before they get married --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- you know ,
[A] the minute they get married , everything 's supposed to be cut and dried
[A] and --
[B] Right .
[A] -- and , well , of course , another one of their mistakes , I think , is they have a tendency to change characters , or to change the characters ' , uh , uh , personalities --
[B] Halfway through ,
[A] -- well , especially after they get married .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Um , couple of examples would be , um , well , like I said , this one about Max S- , or Get Well Smart , the female character , Barbara Feldon --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- she had been at the beginning the , the intelligent one , the , the one who always solved the things and , and figured out and kept Max from getting real messed up .
[A] Well , in short , whenever they got married , she got dingy .
[B] Oh .
[A] You know , why would they do that ?
[B] Yeah .
[A] It made no sense .
[B] I , I 'm guess it 's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows --
[A] Unfortunately , that 's probably true .
[B] -- yeah ,
[B] which kind of ,
[B] like in the big soap opera shows , which I do n't enjoy because of that ,
[B] but ,
[A] Well , do you you watch , um , what is that show , WHO 'S THE BOSS ?
[A] That 's , uh , that 's on Tuesday nights I think .
[B] I 've seen it before ,
[B] but I do n't watch it regularly .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well , I --
[B] Usually Tuesday nights I 'm out ,
[B] so .
[A] -- I hardly ever watch it ,
[A] but , as , as I 've seen it , they 've , they 've done sort of the same thing to where they 've , they started to let them get together ,
[A] and then they pulled them apart --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and I think they 're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them , uh , get together , then you lose part of what the show 's all about .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] So . I always thought that was kind of weird .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it 's funny how we , uh , we , we romanticize people --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- like , for instance , where as the teenager , you know , you romance a , romanticize a rock star ,
[B] but when he gets married , then you do n't care any more --
[A] Um , right .
[B] -- or something like that ,
[B] and I think it 's the same with your characters on T V .
[A] Do you think that 's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret , or at least they keep it quiet .
[B] Probably ,
[B] yeah --
[A] I mean ,
[B] -- I know it affected me when I was younger .
[B] I 'm not into rock stars --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- too much lately ,
[B] but ,
[A] No ,
[A] like Madonna and Sean Penn .
[A] Now I do n't particularly like either one of them --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- but , um , uh , their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- or at least , that 's the way I look at it .
[B] Uh-huh --
[A] So I do n't know ,
[B] -- it would have been hard ,
[B] would n't it .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I would think so .
[B] I just , the , the publicity in and of itself , much less the , I mean ,
[B] when you get married you 've got relationship to develop in the first place ,
[B] so , having twenty million people watch you do that .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it 's ,
[A] they would n't be easy .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So , um , well that 's kind of interesting .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So , um , well I guess that 's about all we need to do , is n't it .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I think we 've covered our time .
[B] It 's been good talking to you .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it has been , Becky ,
[A] I really appreciate it .
[B] You 're the first man I 've talked to ,
[B] everyone else has been a female ,
[B] so this is a change .
[A] Well , I think I 've , um ,
[A] you 're the second female I 've talked to .
[B] You 've had a little bit of variety , huh .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it 's kind of nice .
[B] Okay ,
[B] well , thanks so much .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Bye-bye .
[A] Bye-bye .
