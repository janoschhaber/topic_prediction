[B] well personally , I do n't have any children .
[B] I 'm twenty-two
[B] and I 'm doing my Master 's at N C State --
[A] Oh , uh-huh .
[B] -- so , uh , uh , children would n't be very convenient for me right now .
[A] Well , no ,
[A] would they ,
[A] no .
[B] So what , what , how do you spend the time with your children ?
[A] Well both of mine are boys .
[A] They 're --
[B] Um .
[A] -- eight and eleven --
[B] Okay ,
[B] and did ,
[A] -- and they 're into sports --

-----
[B] What , what are you doing ?
[A] Baseball has started .
[B] Oh , okay .
[B] Do , do they play like , uh , like does the eight year old play baseball ?
[A] Oh , oh , yes ,
[A] we start here at , uh , five .
[B] Okay ,
[B] and , and in , in his league do they have like a pitcher ,
[B] or do they have a standing ball or a machine , or what ?
[A] Up until ,
-----
[A] it 's coach pitch , until you get nine --
[B] Okay .
[A] -- which my little boy will be nine in May .
[A] So he 's going to be with , uh , regular pitching --
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] -- and my eleven year old , of course , you know , is pitching .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I , I used to play soccer when I was that age --
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] -- up in New York ,
[B] so .
[A] But yes ,
[A] we 're into baseball ,
[A] and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball .
[A] We even have peewee basketball here .
[A] So there 's always something .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] and how about , how about like on the weekends .
[B] Do you do sports
[B] or do you go out ?
[A] Both .
[A] If we 're not doing sports we go somewhere .
[B] Do you go , how about like for , uh , do you go for long vacations , like a week or something when they have school off ?
[A] Oh , yeah ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[B] In the summer or like in the Easter time , like around now ?
[A] No ,
[A] usually in the summer time .
[B] And where do you go ?
[A] Different places every year .
[A] We ,
[B] Have , have you been out of the country ?
[A] No .
[B] Oh , okay ,
[B] well , first , they always say , get to know your country first before you leave ,
[B] I mean --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- I , I lived in places , like
[B] when I lived in Washington , uh , Washington , D C , I never went to the Washington Memorial ,
[B] and then when I went back to visit , I went to the Washington Memorial .
[A] You know , I 've heard , we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often ,
[A] and that must be the thing .
[A] They really had n't either .
[A] They went to the Memorial , you know ,
[A] when they go , it 's on business --
[B] Right .
[A] -- it 's not really just to getting to sight see .
[B] Right .
[B] Well , it 's , it 's a beautiful city .
[A] Oh , I bet it is , too .
[B] But , the problem is , like first time I went out of here , and they took me to Las Vegas --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and that was the most boring place on earth .
[A] Oh , now my husband and I , we go different places .
[A] But our child- , but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Did , uh , did , like , did you go to Disneyland ?
[A] Oh , yes ,
[A] yes ,
[A] yes .
[B] Oh , okay .
[B] So , but um , now , I do n't know ,
[B] but um , but let 's see ,
[B] when I was eleven I went also to the Caribbean .
[A] Oh .
[B] and , uh , then after that , I ,
[B] my sister lives in Turkey ,
[B] so when I was like fourteen , fifteen , I went , I went to Turkey .
[A] Oh ,
[B] And this Christmas , I went to Turkey .
[B] But basically , it 's a ,
[B] for the past couple of years , I ,
[B] since my parents are , are , well ,
[B] I 'm from Argentina ,
[B] and my parents live down there .
[B] So , all the traveling I do is alone .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , uh , we were never much of ,
[B] uh , a very , uh , family thing , you know , made , like go skiing in Vermont or something .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] That was , uh , that was a lot of fun .
[A] Yes .
[B] But , what happens is we used to fight a lot ,
[B] so there 's never much of a family family thing .
[B] You know , one of those hell family vacations .
[A] Oh , yes ,
[A] but we try , you know , I try ,
[A] my husband also , we 're involved in everything our kids does --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- because , uh , my dad died , you know , when I was less than a year old --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- so I always just had a mother .
[A] So I always thought , when I have kids , you know , I really want to be involved with them .
[B] Well , my dad , all he , all he wanted to do was get money for us ,
[B] so he could buy us material things .
[A] Material things ,
[A] yes ,
[A] that is ,
[A] yes ,
[B] And , and to me , you know , it 's like , now I 'm twenty-two ,
[B] but I still feel , you know ,
[B] it 's like yeah , we never threw a football or something --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and the way I was brought up ,
[B] and he wants me now ,
[B] he , like he , you know , like he wants to be best friends now --
[A] Best friends , now .
[B] -- and it 's very hard for me
[B] because , you know , it 's like you grow up to be twenty years old ,
[B] and it 's always the same man --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and then suddenly he sees that he 's getting old ,
[B] and he wants to be best friends --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- but , uh , you know , it 's like , I can only express myself so much ,
[B] because , you know , um , everything that he taught me , you know , that my family taught me , which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say , I 'm sorry , you know .
[B] It 's like , you know , I love you
[B] and let 's go out and do things together when I do n't feel like it , you know --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and so , that 's that whole thing that he 'll say when , like , like
[B] I 've seen my uncle and his family , you know , does everything together ,
[B] and you know , his kids are , you know ,
[B] when his little girl was five years old and everything , they , uh , they would go to the beach ,
[B] and she could go to sleep at two in the morning --
[A] Oh , uh-huh .
[B] -- you know --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and , uh , I was brought up the same way ,
[B] it does n't matter what age you have ,
[B] just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning , you can stay up --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- you know ,
[B] but his , what he does is , when he gets home , he separates his work from his house .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] you have to --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- I mean , you honestly do .
[A] Now I have friends that I love to death ,
[A] but , and they have children ,
[A] but their children does anything ,
[A] we have to take them , and , you know --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- to do it .
[A] And that really gets kind of aggravating after a while
[A] because you 're saying , Well , I work full time too , you know .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] but , uh , it 's just , it 's just something that , you know ,
[B] my theory is , you know , when , when you have kids and all you , you want to do , well ,
[B] what I 'll do is , you know , like ,
[B] I mean , you might have problems ,
[B] but it 's not your kids ' problems --
[A] Yeah ,
[A] oh , yeah .
[B] -- you know ,
[B] and you got to try to be with them as much as you can
[B] and to , you know , like ,
[B] thing is , is , that , you know , like if , if they would ever happen to have a drug problem , suppose , that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying , I got a problem --
[A] Problem ,
[A] uh-huh
[B] -- you know ,
[B] and , uh --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and that would make any parent feel good and bad at the same time , you know ,
[B] first of all you 're coming to me
[B] and let 's see how we can get rid of the problem , you know ,
[B] and that 's uh , that 's very , that 's very hard to do ,
[B] because once you 're best friends with your parents , then , I think everything go a lot better .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] I agree with you very much so .
[A] Now , we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college ,
[A] and we knew time wise , or , and money wise , too --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- would , it would not have been a good idea to had them then .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] my , my father was raising four ki- , oh well , three kids before he had me ,
[B] so it was , uh , you know ,
[B] you 're trying , to support , uh , four kids ,
[B] and it 's pretty hard --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- you know ,
[B] and I , I told him , listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] yeah .
[B] He says yeah ,
[B] but then I would n't have you ,
[B] I go , yeah ,
[B] but then you would have a lot of money .
[A] That 's right ,
[A] but you ca n't take this money with us , though --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- that 's how I keep looking at it .
[B] But , you know , like , four , I mean fou- , four children is expensive , especially when you consider like , especially for me , which I 'm paying out of state tuition .
[B] I 'm paying , you know , three thousand ,
[B] no ,
[B] what is it , two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester .
[A] Oh .
[B] And , you know , people say , you know , it 's expensive to think it 's college ,
[B] but , if , if everybody would be a little bit responsible , you know ,
[B] it 's like ,
[B] what does it , what does it cost .
[B] It costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose .
[B] Now they go to a state college
[B] and they live at home --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- you know ,
[B] and well , it costs two hundred dollars for books ,
[B] but you know , seven hundred dollars a semester ,
[B] a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead , you know , like --
[A] Oh , yeah ,
[A] if you cou- , if you can ,
[A] yeah .
[B] -- I mean , it 's like , if you plan a year ahead , you can probably save up seven hundred dollars --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- you know , one thousand four hundred dollars to send your child to college , you know .
[A] What are you learning to be ?
[B] Oh , oh , excuse me ?
[A] What degree , I mean , what are you wanting to do after you get out of college ?
[B] Well , I , I 'm doing computer science , computer engineering .
[A] Oh , that 's ,
[A] my husband 's into , uh , computers .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] and , and now I 'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- because since I 'm an international student , they want to send me back to --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- Argentina .
[B] Well , my dad wants me to go back .
[B] So .
[A] And you do n't want to ?
[B] No .
[A] No ,
[A] no .
[B] No ,
[B] because if you go back there , then you can never get out .
[A] Oh .
[B] Like you do n't have any money to , to , get out .
[A] Oh .
[B] So , uh , and , uh , I was thinking , you know , like , Oh my God , you know , I go back there ,
[B] and then , and I get married there ,
[B] and now I have kids there ,
[B] and then I 'll never leave the place , you know .
[A] Then you 'll never leave .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I know ,
[B] and that 's , that 's what happened to my brother .
[B] He came to school up here ,
[B] and then when he went down there ,
[B] he was just so bad off , you know --
[A] Oh .
[B] -- from not being able to stay up here that --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- his life just went down the drain .
[B] So .
[A] Well maybe something will open up for you .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I 've been calling a lot of companies .
[B] There ,
[B] some of them are interested .
[B] Well , at least for a year and a half --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- I can work ,
[B] so .
[A] Well , may- ,
[A] well I 've enjoyed talking to you .
[B] All right ,
[B] same here .
[A] Okay ,
[A] bye-bye .
[B] Bye-bye .
