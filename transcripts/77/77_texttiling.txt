[B] Uh , well what would you say your opinion is on gun control ?
[A] Well , I do n't know .
[A] I 've , I 've had mixed emotions , I guess , when I listen to , uh , the radio and , and watch T V about the different , uh , things that are happening .
[A] Uh , I 'm against it
[A] but on the same token , uh , I went out and purchased a gun just because I wanted the right to do that .
[B] Ye- ,
-----
[A] So I , I have a rifle in the house .
[A] Uh , the ammunition is probably so old I 'm afraid to use it .
[A] But , uh , I bought it for target practicing and , uh , and also because I wanted a weapon .
[A] Uh , how do you feel about it ?
[B] Well , I think , uh , down here in Texas they do n't have a waiting period on handguns .
[A] Huh .
[B] And , I think they need that .
[B] Uh , and I do have a , I have a pistol .
[B] It 's a little twenty-two
[B] and I have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun .
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] An- , you know , I do like to have my guns .
[A] 
[B] Uh , I do n't know if I 'll ever use it , you know .
[B] And like you , my bullets to my little pistol 's probably , uh , about three years old .
[B] Uh , my gun has n't been shot in a year or two .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But , uh , I like to have them where handy .
[A] Well , up , uh , up in New England where I 'm from , uh , you had to get a permit before you could buy any amu- , am- , ammunition .
[A] And I thought that was really good .
[A] And I think if they , uh ,
[B] 
[A] takes two weeks for that system to process , uh , your request for , uh , not as a gun permit but , uh , but to buy ammunition .
[A] You have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that .
[B] I 've never heard of anything like that .
[A] Yeah . Uh ,
[B] That would be nice .
[B] But ,
[A] 
[B] a- , you know ,
[B] the criminals that are going to get their guns one --
[A] I --
[B] -- way or the other .
[A] -- I , I agree .
[A] I think , you know , one of the things that , that , that needs to happen is , uh , to , to stop the impulse buyer from , uh , buying it quickly and , and , uh ,
[B] 
[A] maybe putting a week 's waiting period or something on it .
[A] But if someone 's really determined to , to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place .
[B] Yeah
[A] And you can get them really cheap .
[B] I know
[B] I , I had a waiting period on my pistol because I was down in , uh , Tennessee .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , uh , they had a waiting period
[B] and , uh , we bought it there .
[B] And ,
[A] How long was the waiting period out there ?
[B] About nine days .
[A] Huh .
[A] That was n't too , too bad .
[B] No .
[B] No .
[A] Because if , if you 're going to go buy something , uh , uh , of that nature , I think you , you 're going to have some idea as to what you 're going to do with it .
[A] You 're not going to react that quickly .
[A] In other words , you know , you do n't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day .
[B] Th- ,
[B] somebody wants to do that ,
[B] I , I , at times I think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms .
[A] Yeah .
[A] I do too . Uh , because it does n't make any difference , uh , uh , whether it 's a pistol or a shotgun , I suppose .
[A] They both do the same kind of job .
[B] A shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does .
[A] Uh , yeah .
[A] I suppose .
[A] I never got shot with either one .
[A] But I do n't know , uh ,
[A] I think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun .
[B] No ,
[B] a shotgun 's got too much of a spread .
[B] Or at --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- least ours does .
[B] Uh , it 's , you know ,
[B] you have a little , uh , thing on the bo- , bottom of th- , on top of the barrel --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- where you , you turn it ,
[B] you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get .
[A] Oh .
[B] And the spread changes .
[A] Uh , I 've got a manual single shot
[A] and I guess it does n't have any , any automatic features to it .
[A] The further away I get , the , the , uh , wider the shot gets --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- from the target .
[A] And the closer that I get , the tighter that it gets .
[A] It 's got a hell of a kick to it .
[B] Yeah .
[B] My husband had a , uh , a police gun at one time .
[B] And I shot that thing one time .
[B] Almost knocked me down .
[A] 
[B] And it just a li- ,
[B] I don- , I forget ,
[B] I think it was a three fifty-seven .
[B] I 'm not sure .
[A] Do you belong to a gun club or you ?
[B] He belonged to one awhile back .
[B] Uh , since we moved ,
[B] we 've only been here in Texas for about a year --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and , uh , we ca n't even find a place to shoot . Just for --
[A] No kidding .
[B] -- target practice .
[B] I 'd love to get used to that shotgun .
[B] We traded his pistol for that shotgun .
[A] Huh . Well the , the , uh , clubs that we 've got around here are kind of expensive
[A] but , uh , it 's well worth it .
[A] You can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have , uh , competition .
[A] Uh , I 've never really joined a club because I have n't got the time . Not because I have n't got the desire .
[A] Uh , there 's an annual membership fee , uh , that 's , that 's fairly high .
[A] Plus there 's ini- , an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time , uh , uh , member .
[B] 
[A] So the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club .
[A] Plus you have to pay for the , the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Well , that 's what my husband ,
[B] when he was in that gun club where he was doing that .
[B] It , you know ,
[B] he went mostly just to , uh , shoot at paper targets .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Uh , but , you know , they used speed and accuracy and all that .
[A] I think that , that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose .
[A] In fact , I 'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to , uh , show that you 've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon .
[B] That 's a good ,
[B] I 've never thought of that .
[A] 
[B] That 's a good point .
[A] And , you know , it , it ,
[A] even after you wait your nine days , if you do n't know how to handle it , it 's just like putting someone in an automobile that does n't know how to drive .
[A] And you give him a license because he waited nine days .
[B] Yeah .
[B] That 's ,
[B] and , yeah .
[A] He could , he could not only , uh , uh , shoot himself .
[A] He could , he could , uh , mishandle a weapon . Leave it at home and let a child get at it .
[B] It ,
[B] well we , uh , we was living on a navy base down in Memphis
[B] and , uh , this one guy decided to play , uh , lonesome cowboy or something .
[B] And he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot .
[A] Wow .
[A] He was fortunate .
[A] He could , he could of hit something else .
[B] Well , he went tumbling down the steps along with , uh , shooting his foot almost off .
[B] He broke his leg and --
[A] Wow .
[B] -- collar bone and a couple of other things I 'm sure , being ,
[A] 
[B] Mister Cowboy .
[B] I ca n't remember what the na- , the term was going around .
[B] It was about four or five years ago .
[A] 
[B] But . Now , I guess that would be a good idea .
[A] About , uh , private citizens selling a weapons ?
[A] Like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me .
[A] How do you feel about that ?
[A] Do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the , uh , buyer and the seller ?
[A] And , or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system , uh ,
[B] 
[A] because you own it ?
[B] Uh , that 's a hard one because we did that .
[B] But , uh , I think there ought to be some rule against it .
[B] I 'll , uh , you know ,
[B] the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun 's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something , the cops are going to come to you .
[A] Yeah .
[A] I , is n't --
[B] Uh ,
[A] -- there a way to , uh , to deregister yourself after you register a gun ?
[B] I have no idea .
[B] I 've only --
[A] Because I --
[B] -- had one gun
[B] and I 've kept it , you --
[A] -- have ,
[B] -- know , the one gun that was in my name .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Is it registered ?
[B] Yeah .
[B] I- ,
[A] The , uh , the rifle that I 've got is not registered ,
[B] 
[A] and , uh , I do n't know why I never registered it
[A] but the , uh ,
[B] I do n't think you have to register a shotgun .
[A] Um , I , I think it 's , it 's voluntary .
[A] The , uh , the ,
[B] Well , see , uh , my husband has a thing .
[B] If they go to , uh , regulating , uh , all right , uh , banning guns . Pri , pri , pri , private cit- , citizens --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- this ,
[B] my kid is jumping on me .
[B] I ca n't hardly talk .
[A] 
[B] My husband feels that they 'll come and collect everybody 's guns .
[A] Yeah .
[A] I guess that could happen .
[A] It 's just like the , uh , the social security system .
[A] Once they , uh , they gave everybody a number
[A] and now they 're making you , uh , uh , get one at , at birth .
[B] 
[A] And --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- once they have your number , they have your identification .
[A] And if you try to do anything , uh , like , uh , not identify yourself to the government , they know who you are .
[B] Yeah .
[B] And everything about you .
[A] And , that 's true .
[B] Uh , I ,
[B] bu- , bu- , you know , they know so , how much money you make a week to , uh , probably your , uh ,
[B] my kid is banging .
[B] I was seeing what they was banging on .
[B] Uh , I 've lost my train of thought .
[B] I 'm sorry .
[A] That 's all right .
[A] You , you were talking about , uh , uh , --
[B] Oh , the Soc ,
[A] -- Fed , what the Federal government knows about people .
[B] Yeah .
[B] They , they probably know everything from , half the time wh , ho , what time you go to the bathroom .
[A] They probably do .
[B] No ,
[B] that 's that 's a little bit extreme .
[B] But they could know anything and everything about you .
[B] And , uh , I 'd like to have my gun .
[B] If they go to banding , banning them , I 'd lose my gun
[B] but we would n't lose our pis- , our , uh , shotgun .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And , uh , we 're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But I do n't , I do n't , uh ,
[A] Do you find it difficult picking up , uh , guns that , that are not registered ?
[B] No .
[A] No .
[A] I do n't either .
[A] I can , I can buy some , uh , today if I wanted to .
[A] Just --
[B] Yeah .
[B] W- ,
[A] -- you know , put up the money .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Well , you can look in the , uh , the ,
[B] we got a thing down here called A SHOPPER .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] It 's a , a ho- , it 's a , it 's a bargain thing .
[B] Uh , you go and ever- , you know , always see guns in there .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Five to seven guns a day .
[B] It comes out every Tuesday .
[A] And there 's , there 's no waiting period on that .
[B] No .
[B] None whatsoever .
[A] 
[B] You call ,
[B] we sold a refrigerator through it
[B] and it took us all of twelve hours .
[A] To sell the refrigerator ?
[B] Yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[B] You know . And I 'm sure it 'd be even less for somebody with a good gun .
[A] Huh . And I think the Federal government is , uh , is really far away from , uh , uh , control .
[A] I , I do n't believe in , uh ,
[A] I 'm s- , I should n't probably say control .
[A] I mean regulation .
[A] Control is something that I would n't want the Federal government to have .
[A] Uh , but I would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Well , I agree with you there .
[B] They do have too much control over us already .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Uh , we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have .
[A] Unfortunately , we , uh , we vote for the , the people who spend the money ,
[A] so I ca n't complain too much .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I guess so .
[B] I do n't know .
[B] They 're ,
