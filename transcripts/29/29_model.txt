[A] Well , how do you feel about it ?
-----
[B] Well , uh , I do n't have any strong convictions about it ,
[B] that 's for sure .
[B] Um , I know I have n't done any Peace Corps service ,
[B] and I do n't know anybody in my immediate family that has , or , you know , has ever even thought about it .
[B] Do you know , uh , do you know anybody that 's been it ?
[A] No ,
[A] the , the only people I know that have done anything remotely like that are people that have gone to be missionaries ,
[A] and that 's only because I went to Baylor ,
[A] and a lot of students from Baylor go and , and serve as missionaries during the summer .
-----
[A] But I think , I think that 's a terrible idea .
[A] That 's like forcing someone to donate to a charity .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I mean , and it 's nice to , to try to teach young people some , some , uh , uh , civil , uh , consciousness , but forcing them to , to donate basically their time and efforts ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it 's definitely up to the person , uh ,
[B] so , I 'd have to say that , uh , it , you know , the people who do it , well , some feel it 's rewarding .
[B] I do n't know , you know ,
[B] but , uh --
[A] You have to ,
[B] -- I do n't know how we got the subject , MUMBLEx .
-----
[A] I do n't either .
[B] I have nothing to say about this .
[A] I do n't either .
[A] I was , I almost hung up , because I thought , well , gosh , I do n't , I do n't really have an opinion except for no ,
-----
[A] I think that 's dumb .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] But , uh ,
[B] Well , how long you been in San Antonio ?
[A] I 've been here for , um , just almost , fiv- , well , no , almost four years .
-----
[B] Um , okay .
[A] And I lived with Dana in school .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] That 's how we know each other .
-----
[B] And , uh , you , you were just up there then , huh .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] last weekend . We went to Six Flags Saturday .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] Had a good old time .
-----
[B] Well , that 's good .
[A] Well , back to the topic at hand .
[A] What other types of community service would they be talking about .
[A] I mean , the , the recording mentioned the Peace Corps .
[B] Well , it sounded like , I mean , this is like major long term commitment , like a year --
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- or six months ,
[B] or , so you 're looking at the Peace Corps or sabbatical maybe ,
[B] or , you know , I do n't know ,
[B] I mean , but , uh ,
[A] I mean , I 'm all for donating my time to worthy causes ,
-----
[A] like I do some volunteer work here and there ,
[A] and every once in a while I 'll do , uh , a , uh , local Big Brother Big Sister thing .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Or I 'll go , you know , do a MUMBLEx .
[B] But that , that time is minuscule compared to what , what ,
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] MUMBLEx they were referring to .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I could n't possibly commit a year or two of my life to , to go do something .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] they could n't cover my hourly rate .
-----
[B] I could n't afford it .
[A] No kidding .
[B] But , uh ,
-----
[A] I have this thing against bugs , too .
[A] And seems to me like the Peace Corps ,
[A] they send you someplace that there 's a lot of bugs MUMBLEx .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] Africa .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] have to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything .
[A] I 'd probably catch a terrible disease and die .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] well . I doubt that ,
[B] but ,
[B] you know how it is MUMBLEx .
-----
[B] W- , I , I mean , it would , it would have to be tough going somewhere you do n't know the culture , usually , I guess .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I think that maybe that 's why some people do it is , uh , to see the other cultures or , you know and some of that .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But , uh , to do that , I do n't know ,
[B] I 'd have to be ,
[B] I do n't know .
[A] Oh , I do n't know either .
-----
[A] MUMBLEx Growing up , all I knew was you go to high school , you , you know , you work , you go to college , you get out of college , and you get a good job and you work .
[A] And , and none of this , you go spend two years in the Peace Corps to ex- , to broaden your horizons .
[B] Uh-huh . Well , you know , uh , I know American Express ,
[B] I 'm n- , I 'm working at American Express now ,
[B] and they ,
[B] after a certain amount of years of service , these employees can take off like six months or something , for some type of sabbatical or some , you know , some , something like that .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And they 're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off .
-----
[A] Oh .
[B] So , it is something that I think , uh , you know , even the larger organizations will support .
[B] Uh , it 's , it 's really for the community to give , you know , to , to give back to the community type of thing .
[A] MUMBLEx .
[B] I do n't know ,
[B] it 's for , I think , at the same it 's for some people to , you know , help them grow in other areas ,
[A] Kind of like joining the military .
[A] Well , I mean , in that respect a lot of people join the military to , to grow up --
-----
[B] Yeah ,
[B] m- ,
[A] -- and to decide what they want to do ,
[A] and the Peace Corps or something like that is probably useful as , as that kind of a time .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] maybe a little bit in that perspective ,
[B] but , uh , and a lot of people have gone in the military , I mean , you know , when they 're in the college .
-----
[B] Sometimes it 's to sup- , help support college , you know ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] the money .
[B] Uh , others , people do n't know what they want to do .
[B] But as far as , uh , you know , the Peace Corps . I guess , I suppose there 's a few people that have done it at that point in their lives .
[B] But I think a lot of it 's , you know , when the- , people get older , they 'll do something like that .
[A] I 'd probably have a different perspective if I actually knew someone that had gone into the Peace Corps .
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] But I do n't .
[B] I , I , I do n't .
[A] and none of my ,
-----
[B] Did n't mean to cut you off there .
[A] Oh , that 's okay .
[A] N- , and none of my really close friends in college went off to be missionaries or anything .
-----
[A] So I do n't really know anyone first hand that 's , that 's com , committed a chunk of their life to do service work .
[B] I ,
[A] Everybody I know has been ,
[A] well , I 'm going to go get a goo , good job and make some money and buy a nice car .
[A] So .
[B] Yeah , or , or try to make a living .
[A] Yeah .
[B] But , uh ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] I , I have no , I do n't know anybody that 's done that either .
[B] So , I , I ,
[B] it 's interesting we got this topic because I , I , I do n't know what I marked off to get this ,
[B] but .
[A] I certainly did n't mark off anything to get this one .
-----
[A] I , I ca n't imagine ,
[A] and the switchboard 's been down for several days ,
[A] and the last time I called it before it went down , I had this topic ,
[A] and I did n't feel like talking about it ,
[A] so I hung up ,
[A] and I guess they , they keep you on the same topic until you actually talk to somebody about it .
[B] So you had the same one , huh .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] Oh , well . Well , you 'll , you 'll get it over with here .
[A] I know .
[B] How many times have you talked ?
-----
[A] Oh , probably five or six .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Not a whole lot .
[B] Oh , I 've done maybe four or five .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Did Dana sign you up for this ?
-----
[B] Well , she just sent me the information out .
[B] I , I got a hold of it , you know ,
[B] I just sent it back in ,
[B] and .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's ,
-----
[A] she stuck my name on some list ,
[A] so they mailed me the information that I filled out MUMBLEx .
[B] What other topics have you had ?
[A] Um , I 've talked about camping with someone .
[A] I 've talked about the weather .
[B] Great ,
[B] great .
[A] That one was interesting because I talked to a man in , in Washington , D C ,
[A] and it was hot here ,
-----
[A] and it was snowing there .
[A] So that was pretty interesting .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And I talked to someone about the , uh , the , uh , education system .
[A] I forget exactly what the focus was on that one .
[A] But that was fairly interesting .
[A] And I talked to somebody about credit card usage .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And I talked to this person who I gathered from speaking to her , that , that she and her family just did n't have much ,
[A] and they did n't have much credit available to them .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And so she basically did n't use credit cards and did n't know very much about them and how they work ,
[B] Huh .
[A] and , and how you can use them to your advantage , and , and how , you know , you , you can do certain things with them .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I always , I use everything with my Visa ,
-----
[B] and I pay it all off .
[A] Yeah .
[B] So that 's a good deal for me .
[B] I get free money for thirty days .
[A] Yeah .
[B] That 's the way I use them , uh --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- I try , I try to make sure I do n't get in debt .
[B] So .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well that 's always a good plan .
-----
[A] I ca n't think of anything else that I 've talked about .
[A] All that th- , most of the ones on the list , I checked off stuff like football and , and stuff that I can , I , I would enjoy talking about
[A] and I have n't gotten a one of them yet when I 've called .
[B] I had , uh ,
[B] let 's see ,
[B] I 've had fishing ,
[B] and , uh , I ca n't remember , me and , I think me and Dana had football .
-----
[B] Yeah ,
[B] we did .
[A] Oh , how funny .
[B] Yeah .
[B] MUMBLEx So we talked about the Cowboys a little bit .
[B] And , I 'm out here in Phoenix ,
[B] so we talked about Phoe- , Cardinals .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , so , so that one was all right .
[B] And then what else did I have ?
[B] I think I had some other , uh , like staying in shape or working out .
-----
[B] This other guy , I got this guy from New York ,
[B] so .
[A] I had to talk to someone about hobbies ,
[A] and the switchboard called me ,
[A] so I was caught a little off guard ,
[A] and I could n't think of anything at all .
[A] So I started making stuff up .
[A] I told this woman that my hobby was gardening ,
[A] and I ca n't even --
[B] And you 've probably never gardened in your life MUMBLEx .
[A] -- I ca n't even grow an ivy .
-----
[A] My grandfather gave me a plant once ,
[A] that told , and he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill ,
[A] you could freeze it ,
[A] you could , you could dry it out ,
[A] no matter what , you could n't kill it .
[A] Well , I killed it pretty quick .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I do n't have too much of a green thumb either .
[B] So .
[B] I do have one plant here ,
[B] it 's been hanging out for a while ,
[B] but I think it 's one of the easiest plants .
[B] I ca n't , I do n't know the name of it ,
[B] but I 'm not too much into ...
