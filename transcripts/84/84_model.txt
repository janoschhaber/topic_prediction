[A] Okay ,
-----
[A] this topic is , is Russia a threat to our security ?
[A] I think they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time .
[A] how do you feel about it ?
[B] Well , they do have , uh , a major internal problem .
[B] Everybody wants to defect ,
-----
[B] and I can understand why .
[B] Um , I think their biggest problem is just , you know , obtaining food to live ,
[B] so when you have the basic needs , uh ,
[B] being unmet , I do n't think you think globally as far as , you know , being a threat to other people in the world .
[B] So , as soon as they get their , their own home country taken care of , then they 'll consider ,
[B] what they can do with the rest of the world .
[A] I believe Communism is very much waning .
-----
[A] It 's , uh , pretty much on the way out of the door , insofar as the strong hold that they used to have ,
[A] and the Russian people are all realizing that the Communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world ,
[A] and their rebellions right now is the result of that .
[A] If they can get the army ,
[A] or the military to sway to their side , I think that , uh , it will be on the way out eventually .
[A] It 's just a matter of time , because ,
[A] in the Baltic States they have already massacred so many people who protested ,
[A] and that has n't set too well with their diplomacy for the , regarding the , uh , outcome of their affairs .
[A] What 's your synopsis ? .
[B] Well , I do , I do realize that , uh , uh , the Bush Administration is n't too happy with , with how they 're handling their internal , uh , strife , you know , as far as diplomacy is concerned .
[B] I think it 's been a good , a good positive direction for uh , the Soviets as far as Yeltsin is concerned .
-----
[B] You know , he was , uh , allowed to ,
[B] what , wh ,
[B] in his , in the Congress they , they gave him more power as far as his republic in Russia is concerned , which is , gives him more power overall , which I think is a good sign that there will be some , you know ,
[B] politically speaking , you know , he 's going to have more power ,
[B] , and I think it 's a step in the right direction .
[B] I think Gorbachev realizes that he 's got a , a major uh , uh , power figure , you know , competing against him ,
[B] and I think it 's going to be pretty close to his demise if he does n't follow suit with Yeltsin as far as , uh , realizing ,
[B] well , he does realize it , you know , with the fact that they reduced the uh , or they , increased the prices on their food , food and goods .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Uh .
[A] I think that it went up a thousand percent on most ,
-----
[B] It ,
[B] yeah .
[B] Tha- , that 's incredible
[B] but they had to , uh , go in the direction of a market driven economy ,
[B] and , and they had to bite the bullet for that .
[B] So that 's a good move , on , on Gorbachev 's part in doing that .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] So ,
[A] but Gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that ,
-----
[A] he 's moving towards a two to three party system of government that , nor eliminating or diminishing the Communist power ,
[A] and I guess that 's where Yeltsin steps in , so far as his politics of government goes , uh ,
[A] but I do n't know how convinced the people are of him yet , myself .
[B] Well , that 's all they got right now .
-----
[B] That 's their ray of hope .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] So , you know , they 'll go with ,
[B] you know , whoever comes through for them .
[B] I , it , it 's just that ,
[B] the weird thing is , is that Gorbachev is the one that opened the floodgates , as far as with glasnost and poistro- , perestroika and stuff ,
[B] and I think he 's got between the Old Guard and , , and the new , uh , glasnost .
[B] Uh , I think it 's kind of escalated to a point where it 's out of control .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And I think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how , in order to keep the peace on , peace on both sides .
[B] So I think that 's where you know , , kind of where he 's stuck .
[B] You know what I 'm saying ?
[A] Yeah .
[A] Uh , I understand .
[B] And that 's the , that 's the situation that he finds himself in ,
[B] and you know , he 's a tough guy ,
[B] I mean , he 's been through it .
[B] So I have no doubt that he 'll ,
[B] I mean , I , I think overall he 's been a , a , good figure for the Soviet Union .
[B] I mean , I think his intentions and his ideals are , are uh , well intentioned .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And in the long-term ,
-----
[B] but I just think that because of the basic needs that the people do n't have ,
[B] I think that , uh , makes the problem most severe , and makes him look , look worse that what his , um , what his ideals are ,
[B] personally .
[A] I agree .
[A] What 's bad for the Soviet system is that , they have the resources to grow and produce their food ,
-----
[A] but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should .
[B] I think it 's , I think it 's a lot of , uh , oh , how do you put it ? , bureaucracy and , and , uh , one thing , and then all the corruption .
[B] I think there 's a , a large amount of corruption on the , the have and the have-nots .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[A] That 's probably more true than ,
[B] You know ,
[B] I --
[A] a lot of people realize .
[B] -- I know you 're going to have that with every society .
-----
[B] At least we 're more blatant about it ,
[B] but it 's very secret ,
[B] and it 's been going on for years .
[B] I mean , you ca n't change things overnight .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , but if it gets to a point where people ca n't , survive , I mean , there 's revolution . You know ,
[B] and that 's ,
[A] It seems to be headed in that direction too .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] big time ,
[B] major ,
[B] but you know , that 's , that 's what happens when , you know , the cork blows
-----
[B] and you ca n't handle it anymore .
[B] I mean , that 's --
[B] -- that 's the way the world , uh , you know , revolves that way .
[A] and uh , I think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways of changing things , too .
[A] They ,
[A] probably not enough ,
-----
[A] but I 'm sure I lot of it 's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind , of what they 're missing out on .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I think they 're starting to realize ,
[B] but I , I just do n't think they have the resources , if you were to compare , uh , the Americans to the Soviets as far as home computers are concerned or fact machines , Fax machines and cellular phones , and state of the art equipment that we are so used to .
[B] I do n't think they even realize what 's out there , and to what extent .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I 'm sure a lot of them are missing those household items .
-----
[B] Yeah ,
[B] the major conveniences of life .
[A] Yeah
[A] what we consider just , I do n't , normal everyday things to them is real luxury .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Which is unfortunate for them ,
[A] and of course , most of us , we do n't really appreciate what we 've got because we 've been so used to it .
-----
[B] This is true .
[B] This is very true .
[B] And we ,
[B] it 's human , it 's human nature though to take things for granted
[B] and it kind of ,
[B] you know ,
[B] when you 've lost something or , or uh , uh , do n't have what other people have that 's when you tend to realize , you know , what 's out there and what , you know , what you have and what you do n't have .
[A] Yeah
[A] I agree .
[B] So the original question , do we think they 're a threat to our , you know , a security threat ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] Um , yes and no .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I can go with that answer too .
[A] The only yes I could go to is if uh , a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to , to a nuclear exchange ,
[A] but I do n't even see that occurring .
[B] Um , no .
[A] Uh , because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to I guess .
[B] Well , I do n't really feel that the Soviets really want to blow up the world .
[B] I mean , um , we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as , as nonfeeling machine type people ,
[B] and they 're people just like us .
[B] I mean --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- you know , they get up everyday ,
[B] and they put their pants on the same way ,
[B] and they have to eat and everything else ,
[B] and I just do n't feel that ...
