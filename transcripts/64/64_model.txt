[A] Well , how about you .
-----
[A] Do you use P C -s ?
[B] Oh constantly .
[A] Yeah .
[A] You and me both .
[B] It seems everything I do is computer related .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] And if it goes down , then we 're stuck all day .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[A] And so I like the I B M P C , personally .
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] But that 's pretty much everything I 've worked with
[A] and , uh , I 've become so accustomed to it that , uh , it 's second nature .
[B] Yeah .
[A] What do you use ?
[B] Well , I have an , I , I B M P S two , model thirty .
[A] Yeah .
[B] It 's kind of , kind of getting too slow for me ,
-----
[B] but my job , I 'm an E D P auditor ,
[B] so I audit , uh , computer applications both on the personal computer and the mainframe level .
[A] Oh , huh-uh .
[B] And I use my personal computer constantly ,
-----
[B] not only do I do P C type things like , uh , using lotus or word processors ,
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] I also use my P C to emulate a mainframe terminal for our I B M mainframe --
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] -- and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine .
[A] Oh , okay .
[B] So all I have on my desk is my P C ,
[B] but I 'm , I 'm getting , not only our local area network ,
-----
[B] but I 'm getting two separate mainframe machines , also .
[A] Oh , okay .
[A] So we , um , we use , it 's an I B M P S two also .
-----
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] And , um , you know , every now and then the file gets so big , that , you know , it moves slower than I 'd like --
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] -- but I , uh , I do mainly graphic work on it .
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] And , uh , a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And , uh , I do n't know ,
[A] I just , I enjoy working with them .
[B] Yeah .
[A] There 's so many capabilities out there ,
[A] I mean , the things you can do are endless .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I 've become kind of the P C guru in our audit department because it 's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground ,
-----
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] And there 's three of us E D P auditors
[B] and one of the three of us has an accounting background
[B] and so she 's not real proficient in P C 's
[B] and the other just has ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] not used P C 's that much ,
[B] so I ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they 're doing
[B] and I 'm the administrator for our local area network .
[B] And I need to keep that going
[B] and ,
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] So , I , I 'm , I could n't live my life without a P C .
[B] I do n't have one at home ,
[A] We have one at home ,
-----
[A] but I just do n't find the time that I can use it .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Right now I would rather not have one at home , because I would work at home .
[A] Yes .
[B] Um , we 've got a couple of portable lap top P C 's at the office that I end up bringing one of them home a lot ,
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] to do work .
-----
[B] If I had a machine already installed at home I would probably work just about every night .
[A] One of the reasons why I got mine , was before I went on maternity leave ,
[A] they did n't know how they were going to do without me at work because , I am pretty much the , like you said , the guru ,
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] in the office with the different programs and MUMBLEx any trouble shooting that there is ,
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] and , um , so they did n't know how it was going to work ,
[A] they knew they were going to have to get a modem so that we could , MUMBLEx in the decks machine so that we could , in my home , so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so .
[B] Yeah .
[A] But , uh , you know , it 's , uh , it 's almost like we could become too dependent on them .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And oh , I , we use a lot of free lance .
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] And , uh , that 's , uh , pretty much takes up a lot of our day so for as producing transparencies and things .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And , um , it ,
[A] uh , compared to the way the things have upgraded ,
[B] Right .
[A] Have , uh , really ,
[A] what 's the word I 'm looking for ,
[A] I 'm just totally drawing a blank .
[A] But , uh , the way things have changed over the years with the P C and the different programs is just great .
[A] It 's remarkable the things we can do now , and compared to , you know , a few years .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Just the power ,
[A] I 'm , I 'm trying to , uh , get an updated machine .
[A] Mine , uh , is just putting along .
[B] And it 's not fast enough for a new four eighty six chip ,
-----
[B] but , uh ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] I do n't know if my boss will spring for it .
[B] But I 'm determined to brake mine
[B] so he has to get me another one .
[B] We think about that a lot .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Well , that 's what I do .
[B] We had a printer , a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] And we had about ten people sharing this printer
[B] by , it was attached to like a central P C
[B] and you had to take your diskette to the P C to print something .
[A] Um , now that 's awful .
[B] So the first thing when I started working at this bank , is , I said , well , now first of all we need to all be able to share this P C without getting up .
[B] So I talked my boss into investing in a , it 's not a , uh , a uh , real elaborate local area network ,
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] but we can share the printer
-----
[B] and we can , uh , send files to each other ,
[A] Okay .
[B] And we can mail , send mail messages to each other ,
[A] Oh , okay .
[B] which is good enough ,
[B] it 's what we need .
[A] Right .
[B] And then I talked them into buying a H P Laser Jet .
[A] Oh , yes .
[B] And that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it .
[B] But once he bought it , he has been so pleased .
-----
[B] It 's , it 's fast ,
[B] it 's quite ,
[B] oh , it has good copy .
[A] Right .
[A] The copy that you can MUMBLEx with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I 've got a little , little , uh , I B M Pro Printer on my desk ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] but , and I can use either the Pro Printer
[B] or I 've got my P C configured to where I can use either printer . The one that 's on the network or my own .
-----
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] So if I just need something real quick , and I do n't feel like getting up and going and getting what I printed ,
[B] I can just print it in my office .
[A] Um , we 're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer .
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] And , uh , it 's just so ,
[A] the budget restraints and things like that , it 's , makes it difficult
[A] and , uh ,
[B] They have gotten really cheap .
-----
[B] Hewlett Packard makes , it 's actually a dot matrix printer --
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] -- but the quality is almost laser quality .
[A] Oh , huh-uh .
-----
[B] And I think it 's called the desk jet
[B] and they 're , you understand , I think they 're about five hundred dollars now .
[A] And we , uh , got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred dollars .
-----
[B] Oh , really .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I do n't remember what kind they were ,
[A] but , uh , we do a lot of transparencies .
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] Sometimes the color would take too long to plot out .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So they just want black and white , which MUMBLEx see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it .
[B] Yeah .
[A] But , uh , it , uh ,
[B] So that 's all you need for like MUMBLEx charts and stuff .
-----
[B] You do n't need them in four colors .
[A] No ,
[A] huh-uh .
[A] If it was a customer presentation then that would be different .
[B] Yeah .
[A] We would want to razzle-dazzle a bit .
-----
[A] But , uh , it 's , uh ,
[A] yeah .
[A] We have one in the office
[A] and if we want , well in our area , if we want to use it , we have to , you know , like you said , you had to change it , put it on a disc ,
[A] And carry it over to there , and see if they 're not using the printer ,
[B] You use the sneak- , system .
[A] Right .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And , uh , wait for an opportunity to use it .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] we you 'd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer .
-----
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] Until they got off the machine .
[A] I know ,
[A] I know ,
[A] I understand .
[B] That was ,
-----
[B] I was amazed when I came to work ,
[B] I worked at the , uh ,
[B] well , it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until N C N B came up and bought the rival
[B] and now N C N B .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] And now N C N B 's got a little larger market share ,
[B] but it 's the only , uh ,
[B] well , it 's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in Texas .
[B] It 's the only one that 's still alive .
[A] Oh , huh-uh .
[B] Any way , I work in a big prestigious place .
[A] Right .
[B] And I could n't believe when I walked in the door on my first day and here 's the audit department of this , this huge holding company , sharing a H P Rugged Writer .
[B] I was going oh , wait a minute .
[B] Come on guys ,
-----
[B] this is crummy .
[A] So how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you 're behind the times in technology .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[B] We 're pushing real hard though .
[B] We 're , we 're trying ,
[B] well , see , the entire bank is not like that .
[B] We ,
[B] the , the bank philosophy is one of innovation and ,
-----
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] Lead the market .
[B] It 's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the , uh , the senior vice president , over audits , is cheap .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] And it 's real hard to pry money out of him to , to do these things ,
[B] but I was , I was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better
[B] and ,
[A] Right .
[B] Um .
[A] We find it hard to believe sometimes , or hard to understand when , uh , we work for a computer company , and , uh , how are we supposed to present the imagine that we 're supposed to present with equipment that 's outdated ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] That 's obsolete
-----
[A] and the guys that , some of the guys that run this place are very tight
[A] and it 's like , Well , why do we need this ,
[A] ca n't you do that with , you know , what we have ,
[A] and when we try and then they complain about , this does n't look good .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Unfortunately , the , the , uh , computer equipment and , and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly ,
[B] like for instance , we bought a ...
