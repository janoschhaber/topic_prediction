[A] Okay ,
-----
[A] do you have .
[B] Are you there ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] Okay .
[A] There , okay .
[B] Okay .
[A] Had to mess with my phone here .
[A] Um , do you have children ?
[B] Yes ,
[B] I have one .
-----
[A] Oh , okay .
[B] How about you ?
[A] I have three .
[B] Oh , my goodness .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] uh , do you work ?
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I do .
[A] Okay .
[B] I do ,
[B] I work
[B] and , and , uh , Brian 's in a day care center .
-----
[B] He 's uh , he was two in December ,
[A] Oh .
[B] so he 's not quite two and a half yet .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] He ,
[B] uh , I put him ,
[B] I 'm kind of had different , different ideas from what probably the majority of people have ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I put him in a day care center from the very beginning .
[B] He started in day care when he was eight weeks old .
[A] Oh , no kidding .
[B] And I just ,
-----
[B] I do n't know ,
[B] I have kind of the opposite opinion of most people ,
[A] Really .
[B] I have had this real problem with a , a private individual .
[B] I mean I , I kind of looked at it like if you take him to a home with a , with private individual , when the door shuts ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] that one person has total control ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and I always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and if you get one bad apple , there 's are at least other people that can see it .
[A] Yeah .
[B] They can watch ,
[B] and --
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[B] -- I just kind of always felt that the chances of something happening were less .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Because there 's ,
[B] You know , how can you help depending on the day care center , you know ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] you got to when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers ,
-----
[B] have you ever noticed they 're always like a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it , you know , kind of thing .
[A] It 's like a family thing .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[B] You never hear about it really in the big ones .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] So , that 's what I did
[B] and I have had just excellent luck .
[A] Oh , good .
[B] I have been just so happy .
[B] He 's ,
-----
[A] Oh , good .
[A] I was just going to ask you how it , you know , if you liked the , the ,
[A] but obviously you do or you would n't have him there , I know ,
[A] but ,
[B] Right .
[B] Right .
[B] Well he was in , he was in the same center for two years ,
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] for the first two years ,
[B] and , uh , it was wonderful ,
[B] and I loved it ,
[B] and I was so happy there
[B] and the woman who owned it sold it .
[A] Oh , gosh .
[B] But , I thought okay , I 'm going to keep an open mind here ,
[A] Right .
[B] and the people who came in , it just was n't , it ,
[A] Was n't the same .
[B] just was n't the same
-----
[B] and their ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] their attitude and philosophy was just completely ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] opposite from mine ,
[B] and I left him there for about a month and just decided I ca n't do this anymore ,
[B] and I ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] moved him , which was an extremely traumatic experience
[B] but .
[A] Was it ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] but , he 's done well ,
[B] he 's been there ,
[A] Good .
[B] a couple of months now ,
[B] and I just feel so lucky .
-----
[A] Oh , good .
[B] Yeah .
[A] That 's great ,
[A] that 's good .
[B] How about you ?
[B] Do you work
[B] or do you get to stay home with them ?
[A] Well , I got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years .
[A] My oldest one is ten and a half now ,
-----
[B] Wonderful .
[A] or she 's , I guess ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] it 's ,
[A] was about ten years .
[A] So I , yeah , I , I was really happy that I was able to do that .
[A] But , I ,
[A] that 's what I wanted to , because I , uh , you know I just could n't wait to have kids
[A] and so , if I was ,
[A] I was so anxious to have them
[A] and I could n't wait to have them it would be kind of silly , you know , to go back to work as soon as I had them ,
[A] so ,
[B] Right .
[B] Right .
[A] so , it , it , it , it was really great .
[A] By the end of the ten years I was really ready ,
[B] Yeah .
[B] I bet .
[A] to go back to work ,
[A] and my youngest was only , uh , two and a half .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I mean she was already two and a half ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] so it was n't , you know , she was n't an infant .
[B] A baby .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] so , I felt real good about that ,
[A] but , uh , boy , I tell you with summer coming up I 'm just pulling my hair out , in terms of what I 'm going to do ,
[A] I , I guess I ,
[A] went back to work about a year and a half ago
[A] and , uh , I worked full time all last year
[A] and now I 'm going to school part time and , uh , graduate school ,
[A] and I 'm working part time .
[A] And , so I 'm still ,
[B] I know how that goes .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[A] I 'm still going full time ,
[A] but I only have half time salary ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] and , uh , when school lets out , I just do n't ,
[A] I have n't , I have no idea what I 'm going to do ,
[A] because I certainly ca n't afford what we did last year --
[B] Right ,
[B] right .
[A] -- which was ,
[B] Did you have them in a center or something last summer ?
[A] Well , we did ,
-----
[A] we tried , we had all different things ,
[A] we sent them to camp .
[A] One ,
[A] first month , in June , they went to summer school , then the second month they ,
[A] uh , one ,
[A] my daughter went home to visit my Mom for a while and my son , uh , went to camp
[A] and there we had , uh , I do n't know some ,
[A] forget what else we did
[A] but it was all , uh , really expensive .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that stuff is expensive .
[B] It really is .
[A] So , now they 're a year older ,
[A] and I ,
[A] my daughter 's eleven , going to be eleven this summer
-----
[A] and my son will be ,
[A] nine and a half .
[A] And so ,
[A] I 'm not ,
[A] I think I can leave them home ,
[A] for a ,
[A] if I can work part of the day , you know , I 'm going to leave them home .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[B] I was going to say they 're getting to the age where ,
-----
[A] Right .
[B] you should be able to trust that a little bit ,
[B] yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Yes ,
[A] in fact I 'm doing that right now with their afternoons , when they get home before I do . You know ,
[A] that 's okay .
-----
[A] But , the four year old now I hav , I have had her since I went back to work , or before I went back to work really , in a home day care situation ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and , uh , we 've just been really thrilled ,
[A] with it too .
[A] We were what ,
[A] actually we ,
[A] it took us two or three different people to find ,
[B] To find the right one ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] that 's what we have to do though .
[A] Right .
[A] But , I was n't embarrassed to shop around you know , --
[B] No .
[A] -- so , the , the person we found it through the ,
[A] there 's an association here in town of professional home ,
[A] care providers or something like that .
-----
[B] Where do , where do you live ?
[A] In Plano .
[B] Plano ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] and they have a number you can call
[A] and all these people are registered with their association
[A] and , you know , go like our , our , uh ,
[A] I do n't want to call her a baby-sitter ,
[A] she 's does n't like ,
[A] to be called that ,
[A] care provider .
[B] Care provider .
-----
[A] Right .
[A] She goes to seminars
[A] and , uh ,
[B] Oh , that 's wonderful .
[A] she gets home visitations by the s- , MUMBLEx I do n't know , the state boards , I guess , some of them and then some by the association ,
[A] and they have weekly meetings and everything
-----
[A] and , so it 's just really , really well regulated .
[B] That 's great .
[A] And , she 's just great .
-----
[A] In fact , uh , she 's all upset because Galen is going to go to kindergarten next fall
[A] and she says this is it ,
[A] you know , I 'm not going to have her anymore
[A] and I said , Oh , no , do n't count on that .
[A] After noon classes she 's going to be here because she 's going to morning kindergarten .
[B] Right ,
[B] right .
[A] So , but , we , we 've tried , we 've tried everything
[A] and one year , I guess last year when I went back to work I had
[A] my son was eight at the time , just barely eight ,
[A] and , uh , we put him in Amrein 's Day Care , after .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] I 've heard that ,
[A] After ,
[B] they were very good .
[A] Well , that 's why we picked it , because they were , were supposed to be real great ,
[A] and , you know , I think they were fine ,
[A] but the thing is he was in school all day ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] in second grade ,
-----
[A] in , in Plano , it 's open classroom situation where they do n't have walls ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders ,
[B] Oh .
[A] in the same area with no walls .
[A] And , uh , and then he 'd get on the Amrein 's Bus to go to Amrein 's
[A] and then there would be a whole ton of other kids , all in the same room , you know ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] you know what fun they had with these computer games
[A] and then they 'd go outside for awhile ,
[A] they had snacks and story time and everything .
[A] But , it was just like going to school until five thirty at night instead of being able to get home at two thirty .
[B] Poor kid was in school all day .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Because he was always around with a crowd of kids and he just really missed being able to be by himself ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and having some peace and quiet
-----
[A] or , you know .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Even at that age they need that time ,
[A] Yes .
[B] we all need that time ,
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] just some quiet time to wind down from the day .
[A] Right .
[A] That 's exactly it .
[A] So , another thing that we tried to do ,
-----
[A] I , I know your son 's too young right now ,
[A] but we 're trying , we tried to sign him up for after school scouts and ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] stuff like that
[A] and ,
[B] I think that 's really important ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and we 've already started about ,
[B] you know , I mean , how young can they start T-Ball and soccer ? .
[A] Right .
[B] You know , I mean , I just ,
[B] you know , we both think of that that as just so important ,
[A] It is .
-----
[B] to get him involved in stuff like that
[B] and ,
[A] It is .
[A] And ,
[B] you could hardly wait ,
-----
[B] I mean , he 's , he 's so much fun now ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] he 's really , he 's really starting to get lots of fun
[B] and I ca n't wait until stuff like that starts happening --
[A] I bet ,
-----
[A] yeah .
[B] -- you know , and , you know , we did the Easter egg hunts ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] which was really the first year he was really able to --
[A] Un , understand .
-----
[B] -- and to know what we wan , know what he was doing --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- you know , and enjoy it ,
[B] and it was so much fun
[B] and gosh he went a couple of weekends ago and rode an elephant
[B] and , God --
[A] Oh , my gosh .
[A] You 're kidding .
[B] -- he got up on this elephant all by himself
-----
[B] and Lord , I could n't believe it .
[A] You 're kidding .
[B] They had so much fun . .
-----
[A] Oh , that 's great .
[B] I bought us tickets and stood there in line
[B] and I thought , I 'm going to end up on this elephant with him ,
[B] you know , .
[B] He did it by himself ,
[A] Well , good for him .
[B] so stuff like that is starting to come along where it 's really ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] getting fun ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] you know .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Day care has just done just incredible stuff with him
[B] and he like comes home with something new everyday , you know
[B] and so ,
[A] Well , that 's great .
[A] That 's so good .
[B] I know , I know they 're working with him
[B] and he 's excited to get there in the morning ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and just does n't even want to kiss me good-bye .
[B] It 's just like bye ,
-----
[B] and he goes running ,
[A] He 's out of there .
[B] you know ,
[B] and he 's always having fun when I pick him up
-----
[B] so , you know . Yeah ,
[B] this , this day care is , is ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] it 's Bright Steps in Lewisville .
[B] And ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] whenever you say Bright Steps , everybody goes , oh , I 've heard that 's the best day care in town , you know ,
[A] Yeah ?
[A] Good .
[B] and it 's , it 's one of those that 's very hard to get into .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and they have , this , this , this woman owns three day cares , two in Lewisville and one in Irving .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and she had to open the second one up in Lewisville because ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] her waiting list was just like , you know , like a year old ,
[B] it was ridiculous .
[A] Oh , my gosh .
-----
[B] And , she 's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other .
[A] No kidding .
[B] Yes ,
[B] so it 's ,
-----
[A] She knows something right , that she MUMBLEx
[A] and ,
[B] She knows what she 's doing ,
[B] all the teachers , like about half the teachers are degreed teachers .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that makes such a difference .
[B] Oh , it makes a huge difference .
[A] That 's the way it is at my daughter 's nursery school too .
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And I think that really makes a difference .
[B] Yeah .
[A] They 're in it because it 's a profession ,
[B] That 's right .
[B] That 's right .
[A] not because it 's a job they could get because they did n't qualify for anything else , you know .
[B] That 's right .
[B] And , his old day care as much as I loved it , you know ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and the owner , I really liked her
[B] and she worked really hard to get good people ,
[B] but the people that she got --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- were there because they were n't qualified to do anything else --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- you know .
-----
[A] Right .
[B] And , and I got lucky
[B] and all of his teachers were ,
[A] Because , because ,
[B] very good .
-----
[A] Right .
[A] Some , sometimes that 's fine ,
[A] that 's great , you know .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] but then sometimes , you know ,
[A] Sometimes it is n't .
-----
[A] You just have to .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Well , is it real expensive then ?
[B] Um , it just went up the first of this month .
-----
[B] I 'm paying ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] uh , seventy nine dollars a week for now .
[B] So ,
[A] Wow .
[B] It 's a little high ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] but , but it 's , you know , it 's like where he was before I was only paying sixty three ,
[B] so there 's quite a little jump there ,
[A] Right .
[A] Right .
[B] but , I looked all over Lewisville ,
[B] I looked in every day care there was --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- in Lewisville ,
[B] and ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] you know , and there were places that were cheaper ,
[B] but is it ,
[A] No .
[B] you know , your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] you know ,
[B] and I have peace of mind ,
[B] where he is --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and some of those other places I would n't have .
[A] That 's exactly it .
-----
[A] See , we do the same thing ,
[A] since Galen goes to nursery school ,
[A] we pay our , our home care provider , for our day care provider , full time for a whole week ,
[A] but she , she 's gone three mornings .
[A] Galen just does n't go there three mornings a week .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] But , I said to her , I said , you know , it does n't matter if for whatever re- ,
[A] when school holidays come around , I used to have such a problem with that .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] They would n't have anything to do .
[A] I 'd either have to ,
