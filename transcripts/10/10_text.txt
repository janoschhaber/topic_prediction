[A] Okay , um .
[A] How has it been this week for you ?
[B] Weather-wise , or otherwise ?
[A] Weather-wise .
[B] Weather-wise .
[B] Damp , cold , warm .
[A] Oh , no ,
[A] damp .
[B] We have , we have gone through , what might be called the four seasons , uh , in the last week .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] We have had highs of seventy-two , lows in the twenties .
[A] My goodness .
[A] Well , I do n't even want to tell you what ours has been like then .
[A] It was ninety-six yesterday ,
[B] I heard about that .
[A] and we set a record yesterday . And , uh , very windy ,
[A] but then today the wind has dropped off , and also , the temperature , so , very cool , uh ,
[A] I think right now it 's like sixty-nine ,
[B] Um .
[A] and that 's cool for u- ,
[A] or it feels cool compared to yesterday , but very pleasant ,
[A] no rain in the last month , I do n't think .
[A] The ground 's very dry
[A] and our yard work , everything is in bloom ,
[A] so our yard work is pretty tough , the ground being dry ,
[A] but I guess it also , uh , brings about allergies ,
[A] we 're having a lot of allergies down here right now .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Everything blooming ,
[A] and , and the weather .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , uh , I think a lot of people have contracted , uh , spring fever too ,
[A] so . Had a lot of people out at work , you know , for fishing , and , and uh ,
[A] and golfing , reasons and things like that .
[B] The blue flu ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] yeah ,
[B] the blue flu , or the white collar flu , depending on where you work , I guess .
[A] Yes .
[B] Oh , we have had , uh , as I 've said , we have had variable weather . Uh ,
[A] Um .
[B] It has been untypically wet for this time of year ,
[A] Um .
[B] and , also , we have a lot of green , you know ,
[B] the grass has been growing
[B] and if you look outside , you would like to go out and mow your lawn ,
[A] Uh .
[B] if you could go out and buy a new spark plug , or something along those lines ,
[B] but fortunately it rains
[B] and you , uh , do not have to go out and buy the spark plug ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] you know .
[B] But , we 've had an unusually , uh , uh , warm spring ,
[B] and , well I guess we 're still in winter ,
[B] and , uh ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] we have had no snow .
[A] No snow ?
[B] To speak of , to speak of .
[A] Um .
[B] We usually average , oh , anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter
[B] and this year , as well as last year , we have had less than four inches total accumulation .
[A] Um .
[B] So , it 's been inordinately warm , uh , here , for , uh , for this time of year .
[A] Um .
[B] So , uh , in that regard , it 's fine ,
[B] but , uh ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I envy you your ninety-four degrees .
[B] I thought I heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday .
[A] Yes ,
[A] yes
[A] it is .
[A] Down in the more southern and western areas .
[A] And , of course we are , um , about two hours from the northern border , straight south ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] and , and , uh , very windy .
[A] It 's amazing to me
[A] because I have only lived in Dallas for three years ,
[A] and I can not believe that the wind blows all the time .
[A] It does ,
[A] I , I
[A] very seldom , if any ,
[A] I ca n't remember , you know , a day that I walked out and the wind was n't blowing .
[B] Uh-huh
[B] Well , I spent six years in graduate school at , in Indiana . In the flatlands ,
[B] and it was that way every day .
[A] Um .
[B] Rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour .
[A] Um .
[B] Summer and winter ,
[B] so , that , uh ,
[B] you , you became accustomed to it , I guess .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But , uh , otherwise w- , as I said , we have had , uh , a relatively mild winter ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] speaking for this area of the country .
[A] Oh , rea- , where did you go to school in Indiana ?
[B] Purdue .
[A] Purdue .
[A] I have a brother that lives in , uh , uh , South Bend , Indiana .
[B] Oh , yes .
[A] And , I had to always ,
[A] I 've lived there for eight years myself .
[A] I 'd always said I was going to go back to school and go to Notre Dame .
[A] But , I did n't . Uh .
[B] Well , you are not from that area originally , I can tell .
[A] No ,
[A] originally I 'm from New Mexico .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] I was born in New Mexico
[A] and we lived in , uh , South Bend for eighty , eight years , and , uh , then moved to , uh , Tennessee actually .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , uh ,
[B] Well , I thought I heard a little Tennessee in there somewhere .
[A] Very much ,
[A] very much ,
[A] cause I , I spent thirteen years there .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , uh , then moved to Dallas about three years ago .
[A] So ,
[B] Gee ,
[B] you 've moved almost , moved around as much as I have .
[A] Yeah , uh ,
[A] my father was in the Air Force ,
[A] so ,
[B] Oh , I see .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Well , I worked for the government ,
[B] so I , I moved , uh , much more frequently than I had intended for sixteen years ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] but , uh , I guess the , uh , this is my first conversation in this , uh , uh , series .
[A] Oh , uh-huh .
[B] I , I received a call last night because of the , uh ,
[B] I had not received my , uh , personal identification number .
[A] Right .
[B] So , I had to call Jack Godfrey today to ask him what it was , because I , I had to abort the call last evening because I could n't get on the line .
[A] Yeah .
[B] So , uh , is there any ,
[B] I 'm not sure how long we 're supposed to talk .
[A] It 's , um , it 's just as long as you want to .
[B] Oh . O- ,
[A] I mean it 's just , uh , as long as you want to , and just , you know , a reasonable lengthy conversation .
[A] Uh , do you work for Texas Instruments ?
[B] No ,
[B] I do not .
[B] I work for G T E .
[A] Oh , okay .
[B] And , I , uh , of course , was , I was sent a , uh , an application from , uh , from Jack .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I 've known Jack for some time .
[B] I 'm in the speech processing business ,
[A] Oh , okay .
[B] and have been for a number of years ,
[B] so I was very much interested ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] in , in being a speaker for this .
[A] Well , actually , I , I work for Texas Instruments ,
[A] and , uh , I 'm an a , I 'm an environmental engineer ,
[B] Oh , I see .
[A] and , uh , they just published this internally , you know , getting people involved .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] So , that , that 's really strange .
[A] I , I was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though .
[A] I was saying , God , do we have a TI in Maryland
[A] or ,
[B] I 'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] If just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative ,
[B] and , um , but I have , uh , I have been a speaker in other , uh , similar type of activities .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , I know the reason why this is , why the , uh , this is being gathered and the program and so forth ,
[B] so , I was interested as I said , I was interested in being a speaker .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] We have n't talked much about the weather .
[A] Oh , well .
[B] I know that 's what we 're supposed to do .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[A] Well , really it , uh , the letter just says , um ,
[A] let 's see , I ca n't ,
[A] I was looking at it ,
[A] I was trying to find out speedy short cuts ,
[A] and I always thought it 's not necessary to measure your time , just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation , and , and , end it when needed .
[A] So .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] In environmental engineering , uh ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] is that with regard to work place engineering , or just , you know , environm- , the work place environment
[B] or ,
[A] Uh , well , it 's actually , um , waste water .
[B] Oh , I see .
[A] Taking , taking care of uh ,
[A] I 'm actually in the air division ,
[A] and we monitor , um , anything that comes out of a stack , or out of a building ,
[A] or , um , we do have customers that , um , their concerns are in the work place
[A] and we take care of that ,
[A] but MUMBLEx ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] within our department . We take care of everything . Waste water , uh , solid waste , and recycling , and , and air and ,
[B] Well , I had
[B] my , the , the call last evening was supposed to be about , uh , concerning recycling ,
[A] Oh , uh-huh .
[B] in the community .
[B] The call I received ,
[B] and so , I had , uh , I had thought a little bit about it , um ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] before hand .
[A] Oh , uh-huh .
[B] So , I ,
[B] but that , that 's interesting .
[B] I have a , uh , uh , friend who is a planner .
[A] Oh , uh-huh .
[B] Uh , a city planner .
[B] And , one of his ,
[B] and he models , uh , city districts , and so forth ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] uh , does computer modeling .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And , one of the , uh ,
[B] he has inputs , or gets inputs from , uh , an environmental engineer . MUMBLEx .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] we actually , our division is corporate wide ,
[A] and we take care of just the Dallas area .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Of course we have several plants here ,
[A] but , um , we do air modeling also .
[B] Oh , I see .
[A] And , and , yeah , I take care of all the air modeling , specifically for the Dallas area .
[A] What we do , we have a weather station , that we get all of this information , you know , temperature , wind speed , wind direction ,
[A] and , uh , we have a huge chemical data base .
[B] Well , that 's interesting .
[A] And , uh , our , our chemical data base , so that we know every chemical on site
[A] and , and , um , its concentration ,
[A] and if , if anything ever happened , God forbid , you know , a building explosion or something tha , we 'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station .
