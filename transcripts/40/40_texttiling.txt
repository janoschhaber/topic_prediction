[A] Well , how , how do you feel about the immigration laws ?
[B] At ,
[B] currently , I think they are a little restrictive . Uh , particularly for , uh , certain ethnic groups or from certain countries .
[B] Um , I think we should permit , uh , more immigration from eastern Europe , for example , uh , particularly the , uh , the Jewish , uh , , uh , people from Russia .
[B] I think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last , uh , several years .
[B] And , I think we have , uh , uh , too much restriction on the , uh , on the Orientals also ,
[B] but , of course , that 's just my opinion .
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] well , I 'm not real sure why I got this topic , because I do n't think I checked it off on the list --
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] -- because I know very little about the current immigration laws .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Well , we seem to , uh , to favor certain , uh , uh , countries particularly South American countries .
[B] And , uh , there is no , uh , uh ,
[B] I have nothing , of course , against , uh , the , uh , the South Americans or , uh , or Hispanics , in that sense ,
[B] but I think we , uh , are more restrictive of the , uh , so called eastern , uh , European countries than we , uh , we should be .
[B] Of course , that 's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern Europe ,
[B] so .
[A] Oh .
-----
[B] And , uh , so I think , uh , you know , the , uh , embargo we placed on the , uh , on the Russian Jews , although we MUMBLEx of , uh , spent years and years , uh , lobbying for their release and their ability to , um , immigrate from Russia --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- as soon as that occurred , we simply said that , uh , instead of the , uh , hundred and fifty thousand or so who wanted to immigrate to this country , we cut that by , uh , two thirds .
[B] So .
[A] Huh .
[B] I do not quite go along with that ,
[B] but .
[A] No ,
[A] that does n't make a whole of lot sense .
[B] No .
-----
[B] And I still think ,
[B] you know , again , kind of having , uh , uh , within this century , come from a , uh , an immigrant family , or immigrant families on both sides .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Both my mother 's parents and my father 's parents were immigrants
[B] so , I 'm a little touchy every now and then about that .
[A] Yeah .
-----
[A] Well , uh , my , uh , my family is from , uh , Europe from , well , from England and Ireland --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and , uh , have been in this country for , oh , more than a hundred and fifty years --
[B] Oh , my .
[A] -- almost two hundred years ,
[A] so , I do n't have any , any , uh , relatives that I am , or , or , uh , several generations back , that I am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family .
[A] They were all , they were all born here --
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] -- so I do n't have any real strong ties with any , with , with the immigration laws .
[A] I do n't , because I do n't , I do n't have any personal feelings about them
[A] and I have n't taken the time or effort to learn what they are .
[B] Well , I think in a way , though , uh , uh , I also have , uh , an opposite point of view , which is , uh , although I believe we should , uh , permit , uh , you know , constant immigration into this country --
[A] Um .
-----
[B] -- uh , I think we should , uh , primarily for economic reasons , I think we should have , um , some quotas ,
[B] of course , my family and I ,
[B] again , again that was , you know ,
[B] my grandparents came over during the time when , uh , there were quotas .
[B] So they had to wait , uh , you know , in , uh , certain parts of Europe for years before they were permitted to come over .
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] So , you know ,
[B] but , uh --
[A] Yeah .
[A] I , I ,
[B] -- I think unrestricted immigration , I think , is not , uh , is not best , uh .
[A] Well , I agree with that ,
[A] I , I think if immigration was entirely unrestricted , uh , not only would , would the United States become over populated , well , more over populated awfully quickly , I think it , it would bring in a lot of , uh , people that are , run out of other countries or in trouble in , in other countries .
[A] I think they 'd come here trying to find a new market for their , their brand of crime .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Well , you know , there 's another aspect of this , too .
[B] They 're also , uh , uh , diminishing the , uh , health restrictions which ,
[A] I was not aware , aware of that .
[B] Well , yes .
[B] There are , were some , uh , regulations over ,
[B] I do n't know whether they 're laws passed or , or whatever they 're called , uh , just recently , where , uh , people with certain diseases can not be excluded , uh , from , uh , immigration .
[B] Age is one , for example ,
[B] and , uh , recently , uh , tuberculosis , which at one time , if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- uh , they dropped that also .
[B] So I think in , in some as- , some ways we are , uh , becoming a little too egalitarian in that , in that sense ,
[B] but , uh , I think we should be a little more circumspect about it .
[B] Again , my opinion .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Think we 've talked long enough ?
[A] I think so .
[B] All right .
[A] Well , I 've enjoyed talking to you .
[B] I , I , I have talked long enough .
[A] Okay .
[A] Thanks .
[B] Thank you .
[A] Bye .
[B] Good-bye .
