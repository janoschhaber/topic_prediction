[A] Uh , being a former drug user .
-----
[B] Whoa .
[A] I , uh , I , I guess I have to say at this point , that I do approve of it .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Uh , because I know that , uh , in using drugs I was not a good employee .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And so I can see from the company 's standpoint that there , uh ,
[A] whenever you are an employee of the company , you are using its assets ,
[A] and , uh , b- , you are also under their liability , under the Workmen 's Comp .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Uh , on my job we had a lot of Workmen 's Comp cases
[B] Where do you work ?
-----
[B] Oh .
[A] And , uh , it 's also a retreading plant ,
[A] and that 's where most of our , uh , injuries occur .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And what we do is we 'll have a drug test if an , if a , a break or a man , uh , has an accident .
[A] Then he 's automatically , uh , given a drug test .
[B] Right .
[B] Do they do it , like , you know , within hours of the accident ,
-----
[B] or is it ?
[A] Yes ,
[A] when he goes to the doctor the first time .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And so , that kind of , uh ,
[A] I do n't know if it 's been a deterrent or not , because we have , uh , just started using it --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- oh , for the past year or so .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Now we 've let some people go , uh , that wa , we , was found that drugs were used in their system .
[A] Now , I do n't know how T E C would handle it .
[A] They have n't pursued it , you know .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Uh , if there 's some , uh , problem I know ,
[A] there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines ,
[A] and he went to a , a separate drug --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- testing firm ,
[A] and they showed it negative .
[B] Huh .
[A] So I think the tests themselves are not really that --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- cut and dried , you know .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I think that 's probably true , too .
-----
[B] That 's , that 's , that 's sort of scary .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] really .
[A] And then I also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And he tested positive on cocaine .
-----
[A] Now then you always wonder , well is he just saying that .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] really ,
[B] really .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's , that 's a bad situation .
[B] I think that probably , I think most companies now , as far as entry ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] you know , exams require that .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I think they should .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I 'm a T I employee
[B] and --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and , and , uh , I 'm , I 'm really gung ho for it .
-----
[B] In fact I , you know ,
[B] some of the places now , um , like I B M do n't allow them smoking , you know --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- in , in the plant .
[A] Right .
[B] We , we have designated smoking areas .
[A] Yeah .
[B] But , um , I work in sort of a building that 's , that 's not really , well
[B] it 's on the campus of the T I facility ,
[B] but it 's a little bit , you know , separated .
[B] We lease the building .
[B] And it 's , it 's a factory environment .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , uh , they , they have designated smoking ,
[B] but it 's just wide open ,
[B] it 's not ventilated properly --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and I think that 's bad .
[B] But as far as the drugs , you know , being in the factory kind of environment that way --
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] -- I think it 's a , it 's a definite , I think it 's essential .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] because you 're endangering everybody 's lives if you --
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- if it 's something like that .
[B] In fact we 've had the policy on just the random testing now --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- for a couple years ,
-----
[B] and , uh , I , I was giving my boss a hard time because I kept waiting for my name to came , come up , you know ,
[B] they never , they never called me ,
[B] they never , you know ,
[B] and finally , the day we declared war was my time .
[A] You 're kidding .
-----
[B] No .
[B] And so , and , and my boss has , has gone for about like three times , I think .
[B] And I told him he 's obviously in a high risk group .
[A] The executives , right ?
-----
[B] Right ,
[B] right ,
[B] and of course , you know , they did specifically single them out when we started ,
[B] you know , that they were going to do all them first .
[A] The executives ?
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Would n't that be awful if you were --
-----
[B] Which I thought was interesting .
[A] -- if you were using , and , and --
[B] Oh , man ,
[B] yeah .
[A] -- oh , lose your job and everything .
[B] Ooh , yeah .
[A] I ca n't believe I was so brazen before .
[A] I , like I say , I 'm a former drug user ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] but , uh , I , I , well , I , I accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior ,
[A] and so I do n't use drugs any more .
[B] Oh , what kind of drugs did you use , if you do n't mind ?
-----
[A] Uh , marijuana , cocaine and amphetamines .
[B] Wow !
[A] Um , yes ,
[A] uh-huh .
[A] And all on the job , too .
[B] Really ?
[A] You know , it had gotten that bad .
[B] Well , it 's really lucky that you got away from that .
-----
[A] Really ,
[B] Cause that 's really ,
[A] it 's , it 's
[A] life is so much more enjoyable .
[B] downward spiral .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] And I was losing jobs just from doing a poor job , you know .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's , that 's it .
-----
[A] I mean , you know , there 's all kinds of drawbacks , much less the drug testing .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Just life in general .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] that 's right .
-----
[B] Yeah ,
[B] well , well I 'm definitely for it .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Plus , you know , you , you want to think that , that you 're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share ,
[A] That 's right .
[B] but that are not endangering your life ,
-----
[B] in some cases --
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] -- like , uh , my husband , uh , several years back , worked for Motorola .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And they had , you know ,
[B] I mean it was a chemical handling type .
[A] Oh , goodness .
-----
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I mean , and they have , they have some serious chemicals out there --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- you know ,
[B] like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water , you know , that kind of thing .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals .
[A] Oh , my gosh .
[B] And that 's really , that 's really frightening .
[A] Yeah .
[B] So I think some place , you know , places like that , it should be like mandatory --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- like , you know , on , on a , on a greater frequency than maybe ,
[A] Right ,
[B] just , you know , paper pushers like , like I am .
[A] I would think there would be .
[B] Well , well you 'd think so
-----
[B] but , uh ,
[A] But they were n't ?
[B] I do n't know if they do it till yet .
[A] Is n't that awful .
[B] Because when he was at ,
[B] course now it 's been years now , because it was before , it was even before they had the , the designated smoking --
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] -- type stuff , you know , at T I .
[B] I forgot what ,
-----
[B] I guess it was like eighty-four , eighty-five --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- something like that .
[B] And they , at that time , they had no testing whatsoever .
[A] Huh .
[B] So that 's scary .
[A] Yeah .
[A] That reminds me of , uh ,
-----
[A] I have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time ,
[A] and I have just casually asked her what he did for a living .
[A] And she said , Oh , he 's the supervisor of this chemical land fill , you know --
[B] Oh , Lord .
[A] -- where they go and dump all this toxic stuff .
[B] Oh .
[A] And I just , you know , went , Oh , where ? .
-----
[B] Yeah ,
[B] should we move ?
[A] Let me move as far away as possible .
[B] Ooh .
[A] Yeah ,
[B] That 's awful .
[A] But , I 'm proud , though , that , that , um , you know , I grew up in the sixties ,
[A] and back then it was popular --
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- you know ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] but people have really wizened , you know , become wise about drugs --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- and they really have a good campaign for the young people , you know .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] They know it 's not smart ,
[A] so .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So , I guess it was just a generational thing .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] peer group is the other way now instead of ,
-----
[A] That 's right ,
[A] and that 's good .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] that 's ,
[A] That 's the best way to stop it .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that , it really is .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well , I think we did it .
[B] Okay .
[A] So it 's good talking to you .
[B] Well , I enjoyed talking to you , Cathy .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] bye-bye .
