[A] I was trying to think about some of my favorite people that I liked in music
[A] and they 're , none of them are recent , right .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] So I like Gordon Lightfoot ,
[A] do you know who he is ?
[B] Yeah .
[A] And the Moody Blues ,
[A] and I like to listen to piano music a whole lot ,
[A] and Willie Nelson .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] So you like a , a variety .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Sort of easy listening because you like country
[B] but then ,
[A] But not all country .
[A] I do n't like that ,
[B] Um .
[A] when they start ,
[A] I do n't know .
[A] I just like Willie Nelson I guess because he 's such a character .
[B] Oh , uh-huh .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I , I like some of his songs , though .
[B] They 're , they 're not so , they 're not so sad country all the time .
[B] They 're just kind of sweet sometimes .
[A] Yeah .
[B] You know , I mean they 're not the , the typical country where they 're just , you know , my wife left me , my dog left me , you know .
[A] My truck is broken down .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] my truck 's broken down
[B] and my house just burned down , you know .
[A] Yeah .
[B] But ,
[A] There , there 's a guy ,
[A] have you ever heard of George Winston ,
[A] he plays piano .
[B] No .
[A] I think he 's dead now ,
[A] but he plays wonderfully .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I like that .
[B] Are , d- , are you , do you play the piano ,
[B] is ,
[B] or you just like it ?
[A] Very badly .
[A] I 've got a piano ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] my mother got a piano
[A] and , uh , vowed that someone in the family was going to learn ,
[A] so we all had to take lessons ,
[A] and I was the one that did the least poorly ,
[A] so she gave it to me .
[A] And it 's sitting here mostly taking up space ,
[A] but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it .
[A] It is real relaxing .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it must be fun to be able to play it
[B] and , you know , if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it 'd be , it 'd be kind of fun , I think .
[A] Yeah .
[B] because I mean , I play the flute
[B] and not many things you can play that 'll , you know , people will sit there and sing along to
[B] and you ca n't sing along either
[B] so , but , uh , I like a lot , uh ,
[B] I like classical music just because of the ,
[B] when , I , I do n't play ,
[B] I like jazz music
[B] but ,
[A] Oh , so do I .
[B] What 's that ?
[A] Forgot about that .
[B] What 's that ?
[A] I said so do I ,
[A] I forgot about jazz .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I like a lot , like ,
[B] I like , uh , is it the New Age music , like with , uh , uh , the ,
[B] I do n't know if you 've heard Neurotic Collection .
[A] Yes ,
[A] we 've got about five of those .
[A] I love them .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I love those , too .
[B] They 're just so relaxing .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] I 'd never heard them before until I went in a music store
[A] and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- and I just , I heard a piece
[A] and it was just so wonderful .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it .
[B] Is n't that nice .
[B] I mean it 's nice when you have a piece that , that is so , so peaceful ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] that everybody likes , you know ,
[B] and , uh , it , it , it , it , you know , it has pieces that are uplifting ,
[B] but , it , it 's mostly relaxing
[B] and you do n't , because it does n't have words , you know , you do n't feel like , there 's anything you have to remember , you know , as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean
[B] or , but , uh ,
[A] I mean you can just sit ,
[A] you know those little booklets that come along with it --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- and you can just see the things that they 're trying to show with music .
[B] Yeah .
[A] My , my little boy has gotten so into it that
[A] he 's identified the , the people that have written certain songs ,
[A] then he buys the pieces that have that person .
[B] Yeah .
[A] You know , on it .
[B] Oh , I see what you 're saying .
[A] Huh ?
[B] Yeah .
[A] I mean , I do n't even know who did which ones ,
[A] but he does .
[B] I , I ca n't identify them either .
[B] I just like them .
[B] I could , I know which ones come next ,
[B] but I do n't even know their names .
[B] Most of them I do n't know their names of the song ,
[B] but I , I can identify them .
[B] But I like that
[B] and I like , uh , course I , I like classical music .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And , uh ,
[A] Were you in the band ?
[B] I was in the band ,
[B] yeah --
[A] So was I .
[B] -- and I was in , like , chamber music groups and stuff ,
[B] so I 'm used to pieces
[B] and , and I played classical flute ,
[B] I did n't play , play jazz flute or anything like that ,
[B] so . I c- , I can relate to it , I suppose .
[B] But , uh , and I like , I 'm like you I like the older stuff , too ,
[B] because I like Chicago --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and I like , I like , uh , , uh , let me think who , uh ,
[B] you do n't know Hebert Laws ,
[B] but Hebert Laws a flute player ,
[B] he 's a jazz flute player
[B] and I like , uh , uh , Chuck Mangione ,
[B] do you know who Chuck Mangione is ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I like Chuck Mangione .
[B] Trying to think of all , uh , oh ,
[B] what 's his name , plays the trumpet .
[A] I like the Moody Blues .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Did you like them ?
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I like Moody Blues .
[B] I , I like mostly the older groups I think .
[B] Oh , c- ,
[B] but we do have ,
[B] I like Simply Red ,
[B] we got Simply Red .
[B] I figure all our C Ds that we have what I really like .
[B] And , uh , I like Breeze ,
[B] I like the group .
[B] I think just because they all sort of sound , they sound l- , a lot like r- , uh , Simply Red .
[A] So what type , Simply Red ,
[A] I 've never heard of that .
[B] Uh .
[A] Is it just instrumental ?
[B] No ,
[B] it 's , it 's got people singing ,
[B] but it 's it is instrumental .
[B] But it 's , it 's got people singing
[B] but it 's got a , like a whole bunch of people singing .
[A] Yeah .
[B] You know , how many people are in Simply Red , Stuart ,
[B] he ca n't hear me .
[B] I , I do n't remember how many people ,
[B] but , it 's , it 's got men and women
[B] and it 's not , it 's , it 's nice ,
[B] I mean it 's pleasant , you know , music .
[B] It 's not where it 's , it hurts your ears to hear it .
[B] But it 's not as , it 's not like , uh , Chicago where it 's got that much instrument to it .
[B] You know , it does n't have , like all the brass and everything .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Well my husband is telling me we have to hit the road .
[A] We 're going to go to Commerce and see a friend .
[A] And ,
[B] Oh , you must live in this area .
[A] then I 'm going to go to Sulphur Springs .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] where are you ?
[B] We 're in Sherman .
[A] Okay .
[A] So we 're in Garland .
[B] Oh , okay .
[B] You 're going to Commerce ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] For East Texas or something ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] Just because there 's a friend up there ,
[A] not because there 's much else .
[B] Oh , okay .
[B] Well they 're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas .
[B] That 's why I was just w- ,
[A] For colleges ?
[B] Yeah ,
[B] East Texas is recruiting for ,
[A] Well , they 're not c- ,
[B] you know , their fall semester
[B] and they 're , they 've been doing a lot of that in the area .
[A] They 're not going to recruit me anymore ,
[A] I 'm through .
[A] No more for me .
[B] No more , huh .
[A] What , what do you do ?
[B] Well , right now I 'm just a homemaker ,
[B] but I 'm going to school , uh , for legal assistant
[B] and that 's what I know ,
[B] so , and , uh , just nothing basically .
[A] Are you going to go to East Texas for that ?
[B] No ,
[B] no ,
[B] it ,
[B] no
[B] I do n't go to East Texas .
[B] I got a degree from T W U ,
[B] but I 'm really interested in legal , you know , in the legal environment ,
[B] but I do n't want to be a lawyer
[B] so I said well , I think I 'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant .
[A] That 'd probably be pretty interesting .
[A] I was summonsed down to the courthouse last week .
[A] They had summonsed eight hundred people ,
[A] about four hundred showed up ,
[A] and it was for a murder trial .
[B] Oh , uh-huh .
[A] This guy had supposedly , uh , strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose .
[A] Anyway , this is happened in nineteen eighty-three .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And they had us fill out a long questionnaire .
[A] We stayed till about one thirty
[A] and they 're going to call the ones that they 're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time
[A] and the trial wo n't take place until June .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's how it works .
[A] And they say it 's going to last about two to three weeks .
[A] And this guy in front of me said , I ca n't believe I was summonsed .
[A] I was an investigator
[A] and I was tailing the woman that was killed .
[A] Well , then I have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that 's a lawyer
[A] and he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband
[A] and the one that 's accused was the one that actually did it .
[A] And she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been , uh , getting cocaine from his client and then selling it ,
[A] and he had skipped bail
[A] and they finally extradited him
[A] and he 's going to testify for the State against her so he 'll have his sentence reduced .
[B] And this is the man that was in front of you ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] Oh , well they 'll ,
[A] The ,
[B] weed him out .
[A] the investigator .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] he , he got off right away .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And I wrote that down on my questionnaire that he 'd told me that ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] so I figure that that will make me biased
[A] and I wo n't be chosen .
[B] Well ,
[A] Hopefully .
[B] not necessarily
[B] but there 's probably something else that might make you .
[B] Because you could know about , you could know about the crime , but not necessarily be taken off the jury , you know , not be accepted for j- , the jury .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I mean , pretty much a lot of people would know about it , you know , and , and know some of the different things about it
[B] but , uh , they , they might weed you out some other way .
[B] You know , if you , if you do n't believe , like if this was a capital crime and , and you do n't believe in --
[B] -- if you do n't believe in death penalty , you 're not going to be picked at all .
[A] No .
[B] So but ,
[A] I said that , I could believe in it in certain instances , but I would be , I 'd find it hard to levy that against somebody .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] so , see ,
[A] You know .
[B] there , there they would have a doubt about you ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] that , you know ,
[B] because if that 's what , if that 's what the punishment is in that , in that instance , then you 're always going to say , you know , not gui ,
[B] you 're , you 're not going to want to have him have that cri- , uh , that punishment .
[B] So ,
[A] Yeah .
[A] But then when you 're , when you 're picked ,
[A] see I was picked for another murder trial before --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- oh , gosh and it 's so hard because , you know , everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done ,
[A] and if you 're trying to hold out , you know , there 's so much pressure on you
[A] and you 've got to come up with a decision .
[B] Well , especially with something where you have to f- , you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt .
[B] You have to find whether they 're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
[B] and it 's like , do you really feel that sure about ,
