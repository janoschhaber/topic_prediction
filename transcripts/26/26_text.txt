[A] Okay .
[B] So , who 's your , uh , favorite team ?
[A] Who do you think ?
[A] The Dallas Cowboys .
[B] The Dallas Cowgirls , huh .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Well , they did have a fairly decent year finally this year .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] At least they 're coming around .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] they 're going to get better .
[A] I mean , you know .
[B] Well I mean , you know , I think , uh , once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established , uh , they 'll do all right .
[A] Yeah .
[A] As long as Troy Ot- , Aikman does n't get hurt again .
[A] That kind of killed them at the end of the season last year .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] So , I do n't , I do n't even know who your favorite team is , actually .
[B] I 'm a Viking fan .
[A] Okay .
[A] I think I did know that , I just forgot .
[A] Okay .
[B] And they have n't been doing too hot ,
[B] so .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Has Herschel Walker done much for them ?
[B] No ,
[B] in fact , in fact the Cowboys got the best end of that deal .
[A] Definitely .
[A] Well , he was a good player . I guess ,
[A] well I do n't know ,
[A] he just never ,
[A] I do n't know ,
[A] for a while there MUMBLEx ,
[B] I 've never been over impressed with him .
[A] Well , he could always get past , you know , he 'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone .
[A] But , um , I guess you never could really see him play , because with the Cowboys , while he was with the team , the rest of the team was pretty poor
[A] so you could n't really tell if it was just him or the team
[A] and I always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team .
[A] But , I do n't know .
[B] Well , who 's the running ,
[B] is it Sammy Smith ,
[B] or is it , Emmett Smith .
[A] Emmett Smith ,
[A] yeah .
[B] Emmett Smith .
[A] N- ,
[A] he 's been doing real good .
[A] I 'm --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- pretty impressed with him so far .
[A] Did he , did he actually play in the Pro Bowl .
[A] I remember he was like a backup
[A] and then somebody got injured
[A] and he was supposed to go .
[B] I 'm not sure .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I kind of , I have n't been keeping up with football , I mean , in the fall
[A] I , I can go on and on about football ,
[A] but since it 's kind of off season , it 's kind of hard to think back about all that .
[A] But , uh ,
[A] ,
[B] Who else is , uh , oh
[B] there 's , you know , Mike MUMBLEx ,
[B] Minnesota Vikings , used to be the general manager starting the World Football League .
[A] Yeah .
[B] So , and th- , and he was trying to keep , uh , uh ,
[B] I ca n't even think of the guy 's name , either , the coach of the Vikings .
[A] Um , I have no idea .
[B] Bu- ,
[B] Jerry Burns .
[A] No earthly idea .
[B] Goin- , ke- , he was going to keep him as the coach somehow ,
[B] but , uh , I do n't know ,
[B] I 'd like to see the Vikings get revamped somehow .
[A] How did they end up this year ?
[A] Did they , did they make it to the play-offs at all ?
[B] Well , they started out really bad ,
[B] they went like one and six ,
[B] and then they won five or six in a row .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] So they were in a shot to make the play-offs
[B] and they screwed up the last couple of games .
[A] Kind of like the cowboys , huh .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I guess you can ,
[A] Except I think the Cowboys are on the upswing .
[A] I do n't know about the Vikings .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Just had n't heard much about them lately .
[B] And the Cardinals were kind of like the Cowb- ,
[B] in fact they were doing better than the Cowboys ,
[B] and the Cowboy , Cowboys came on strong at the end of the season ,
[B] and the Cardinals got killed by the Cowboys ,
[B] so .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Well , the Cardinals , I do n't know .
[A] I think the Cowboys probably have a , a better team .
[A] They just ,
[A] at the end of the season , the kind of got messed up with Aikman getting hurt , because , uh , Laufenberg just could n't ever really get it together at all .
[A] Of course , he sat along the sidelines all season ,
[A] he never really got in a game , never did a whole lot .
[B] Oh , do n't made any excuses for him .
[A] Well , I 'm just saying I should n't , I should n't blast him like that , say , oh well , Laufenberg got out there and blew it for them ,
[A] I mean , he did n't get to see much action . But , too bad .
[A] Because now , now , you know , he had a shot and , and did n't look too good
[A] and so , no one 's going to have much faith in him any more .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] In fact , I think they 're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback .
[A] I have n't , uh , I have n't kept up with it lately ,
[A] but I remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on , or , or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody ,
[A] but it was n't anybody I 'd really heard of .
[A] But I heard on the radio this morning , or yesterday morning , that , uh , Aikman 's back in practicing , doing real , real well .
[A] Um , who is it , Michael Irvin --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- MUMBLEx he said that , uh , Aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time .
[A] So , sounds like he 's going to be all right for next season .
[A] They 're just trying not to overwork him right now , until he gets his shoulder , uh , back in shap- ,
[A] it was his shoulder , was n't it , that he had the problems with ?
[B] I do n't know .
[B] Yeah
[B] I think it was .
[A] I think it , I think it was his shoulder he had surgery on .
[A] But anyway , they 're trying to keep him , you know , keep him , uh , from reinjuring anything , but anyway .
[B] But , uh , well I got my thirty day notice yesterday .
[A] Thirty day notice for what ?
[B] Um , I 'm done , where I work .
[A] Oh , really .
[B] So , anyway , I guess we ca n't talk much more about that ,
[B] but I just thought I 'd throw that in there .
[A] What .
[A] Oh , okay ,
[A] maybe I 'll call you back after , after the recording is finished .
[A] Actually I think we have talked about football for five minutes .
[A] I ca n't remember .
[B] Oh , w- ,
[B] I 've always ran out of time ever since I 've done this .
[A] Really .
[A] I usually have , too .
[B] They always say you 've talked your ten minute limit .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I 've done that once or twice .
[A] I did n't look at the clock when we started talking ,
[A] so I guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in .
[B] Make sure we get our cash flow .
[A] Yeah .
[A] So other than the Vikings , who do you like ?
[B] Um , actually , when I was younger , I was a Cardinal fan , too .
[A] Uh , oh .
[B] Remember Jim Hart ?
[B] Jim Hart was playing .
[B] Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals .
[B] This was a long time ago .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Um , I do n't know who else I 've ever .
[B] That 's about it ,
[B] I was always a Viking fan .
[B] I think I was into the Cardinals for a little bit
[B] and ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Back when they were in Saint Louis ?
[B] Yes ,
[B] oh , of course .
[A] Since they 've been to Phoenix they have n't been , uh , all that impressive , I guess .
[A] I guess I 've always been a Cowboy fan .
[A] Other than that , I mean , you know , when I 've , you know , when you grow up in a city that has the , you know , one of the greatest football teams until the last few years , you kind of tend to get caught up in it .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] well , the Cowboys were th- , America 's football team ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] there 's no question about that ,
[B] so .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I mean it , it was really exciting ,
[A] growing up when , when the Cowboys were really big .
[A] Because my parents would always have season tickets ,
[A] and they 'd go to all the games ,
[A] and you know , the hype were just unbelievable .
[A] It 's just , you know , the last , oh
[A] I guess probably since about eighty-four , about eighty-five was when they started kind of going downhill really ,
[A] but , you know , I 'm just used to always growing up and hearing Cowboys , Cowboys , Cowboys , and , you know , Super Bowl , and all this other stuff .
[A] So , I ca n't , you know ,
[A] I 'm not going to decide I do n't like them just because they 're having a few bad years .
[A] I mean , I think they 'll pull out of it ,
[A] and , you know , they 'll , they 'll wind up being good again .
[A] They 've got some , lot of really good young players that are going to , that are going to , uh , do pretty good , I think .
[A] But , they 're raising prices on their tickets .
[A] So they 're banking on doing good next season .
[A] I think tickets are ,
[B] Again .
[A] Yeah .
[B] What are they going up to , thirty bucks or something ?
[A] Thirty , or thirty-two for really good tickets .
[A] See , they , they sectioned it out even more .
[A] They used to just have like , uh ,
[A] first of all it was all one price .
[A] And then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else .
[A] And now they 're sectioning it off to like from the , from one twenty yard line to the other one ,
[A] just on the lower levels is the highest price ,
[A] and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level ,
[A] and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line .
[A] And then they 're some sections kind of in the corner areas ,
[A] and then the cheapest of course is going to be the end , the direct end zones .
[A] But , um , they have about four or five different prices now ,
[A] that they 're structuring it with ,
[A] but obviously yeah , they 're all going up , MUMBLEx more or less is what it 's going to do .
[B] So now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year .
[A] Um , you know , I 'm not sure ,
[A] I 'm not positive ,
[A] I did n't , I did n't really think about that .
[A] I just remember trying to figure out where you could get
[A] that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper .
[A] But , not that I 'll ever go .
[A] I had n't been to a Cowboys game ,
[A] las , time , last time I went to the Cowboys game was during that , um , N F L strike , or the , when they had the scab team , teams in there ,
[A] and it was the , uh , Dallas and Washington Redskins game .
[A] And I went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets , because a lot of those doctors have season tickets ,
[A] and they , um , if they 're not going to use them they 'll give them to somebody else .
[A] So my dad , I went with my dad to a game that one time .
[A] But that was n't a real , you know ,
[A] it was , it was the scab teams ,
[A] it was kind of , you know , it was kind of different , I guess .
[A] And before that it 's been quite a few years .
[A] I 've been wanting to go to a game ,
[A] I just never , never have gotten around to it .
[A] So maybe this year MUMBLEx .
[B] That 's interesting ,
[B] I almost lost our electricity here .
[A] Oh .
