[B] the company I work for furnishes ,
[B] so I can work at home .
[A] Oh , wow .
[B] And it 's just an old , old compact , that is super slow
[B] and , but it does , it does its job ,
[B] so .
[A] What processor does it have in it ?
[B] Um , I do n't know ,
[B] it 's so old .
[B] It 's one of ,
[A] Oh what kind of work do you do on it ?
[B] Um , I do , um , television ratings
-----
[B] and I process some ratings and put , do graphics for their television stations ,
[A] Oh , okay .
[B] MUMBLEx their clients ,
[B] so .
[A] Yeah .
[B] It 's basically just data entry and running , you know , some , some software
[B] so it does n't really have to be anything sophisticated , you know .
[A] Huh , yeah ,
-----
[A] I do n't own a P C
[A] but I 've , I 've , yeah , I work for T I
[A] and , uh ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] my husband does , too ,
[B] so .
[A] Well , I have , uh , pretty , fa , a fairly fancy one ,
[A] it 's a T I model .
[A] It 's an S P one thousand which , has a , it has a fast processor in it , a three eighty-six .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And I ,
[A] the , the job that I do ,
[A] I do a lot of training of our customers for new products .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And I have to develop , uh , functional specs and , disk and desk top publishing and everything ,
[A] so it 's ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] it 's kind of fun ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] I mean , I , I always say that I need to buy a computer for the house
[A] but I just have n't got around to doing it yet .
[B] Oh , yeah ,
-----
[B] I 'd like to have one for the house , too ,
[B] but sometimes MUMBLEx my husband , my husband says usually , I work on the computer all day at work ,
[B] I do n't want to come home and have to work on one , too .
[A] Your husband , what , what group is your husband in ?
[B] Um , something with the defense .
[A] Oh , MUMBLEx ?
[B] Huh ?
[A] Defense systems and electronics group ?
[B] Yeah ,
[B] something like that ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] they 've changed their name so many times I 've lost track ,
[B] so .
[A] I see .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] He works up in Plano .
[A] Oh , okay .
[B] So .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I work on , uh , printers and ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] the peripheral products division , basically , uh ,
[A] I work in the airline , ma- , marketing group .
[B] Oh .
[A] So , we , we do a lot of ,
[B] I did n't even know they had anything like that .
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] Man ,
[B] there 's so ,
[B] they 're ,
[B] I learned so many things that they , they do ,
[B] they 're into so many different things ,
[B] so .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I just kind of ,
[B] MUMBLEx in for a while , you know ,
[B] he had a , he had , uh , one of those , what are they , top secret things ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] you know , where he could n't talk about what he did , so .
[A] Yeah .
[B] For a while
[B] but then he switched jobs .
[B] I do n't understand half the stuff he does
[B] and , I have , uh ,
[A] Is he a programmer ?
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I see .
[B] Software design engineer , so , as they call it ,
[B] so .
[B] But I have a degree in information management ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] which is computer , you know ,
[A] Right .
[B] it 's basically the , more the bus- , business end of it than the programming end of it , you know .
[A] Right .
[B] So , but I 've been at it for , you know , five years ,
[B] so . Everything 's changed so much I probably could n't even get a job right now .
[B] It seems like it 's changed so much ,
[B] so , you know , they 've made such advances in computers ,
[B] so .
[A] Really .
[A] So , uh , does your husband ever use , uh , a laptop or a notebook ?
[A] Does he bring a little one home with him
[A] or ,
[B] No ,
[B] huh-uh ,
[B] sometimes he bri- , he brought home a , uh , a portable one ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] but , uh , it , it quit working
[B] so he brought it , brought it back
[B] and he just has n't brought another one home .
[B] But they did give him a new computer at work ,
[B] so .
[A] Oh , I see .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] we , we build , uh , laptop and notebook computers here in Temple also .
[B] Oh , uh-huh .
[A] And those are really handy ,
[A] I mean , we , they , they have modems in them , you can send a fax from your P C ,
[B] Oh , how nice ,
[A] but they 're , they 're really ,
[B] no ,
[B] he does n't have one of those ,
[B] so .
[A] What 's that ?
[B] He does n't have one of those .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] they 're , they 're pretty handy because , you know , when I travel , it 's easy to check messages ,
[A] just , you know ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] plug in the phone to your computer and dial in
[A] and ,
[B] Yeah .
[B] Well , my husband does n't have to travel ,
[B] so .
[A] Oh , okay .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I just found out I 'm going to Denver Sunday night again .
[B] Oh , boy .
[B] Well at least you get to ,
[A] So that kind of reeks havoc with plans ,
[A] but , it , it 's really not enough to become a big hassle .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Well , that 's good .
[B] Some people enjoy the travel
[B] but I do n't think I 'd like it , if he traveled a lot .
[A] I see .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I would love to have a computer ,
[B] they ,
[B] but they 're so expensive .
[A] Well , I do n't know ,
[A] there , you can get , well ,
[A] depends on what you consider expensive ,
[A] I mean ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] you can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars , where , you know , just a few years ago it would have been six , seven , eight , nine thousand dollars .
[B] Yeah . You know ,
[B] I guess it 's not , it 's all , you know , it 's , inexpensive compared to what it used to be
[B] but it 's a lot to put into one .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it 's still , I mean ,
[A] you know , two thousand dollars is n't just , just pocket change to a lot of people .
[B] That 's right .
[B] No ,
[B] it 's not .
[B] It 's , it 's not pocket change ,
[B] so it 's major MUMBLEx .
[B] Maybe when the kids get in school that will be , you know ,
[B] when they start needing something , you know , then that will be different
[B] but ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] when I started at , uh , T I , I was a Summer development student ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and finishing up at school
[A] and so those papers really ,
[A] I mean , it was nice having access to the ,
[B] Oh , yeah .
[A] equipment to , uh ,
[B] Yes ,
[B] I remember that .
[B] I had to do some of my husband 's papers because I had access to one
[B] but , you know , he , his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing , you know ,
[B] so ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] I did a lot of his papers .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] they come in real handy ,
[B] that was a lifesaver .
[A] Well , how many different types of packages do you use ?
[B] At home ?
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Um , all I ,
[B] the packages I , I do n't really use ,
[B] I MUMBLEx what I use that MUMBLEx outside development that we use most of it 's just stuff that 's been written in house that I use .
[A] Oh , okay .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Golly ,
[A] I 've got ,
[A] up , up at work anyway , I use WordPerfect and Lotus and ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I know those two .
[A] and MUMBLEx which is , uh , uh , a , a line-draw package .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] I 've just used WordPerfect and Lotus and , the most .
[A] Yeah .
[A] You probably use MUMBLEx or something like that ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] for your , uh , data entry stuff that you 're ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] talking about .
[B] A lot of the data entry stuff they used , uh , survey system and , and , um , you know , just in-house programs to do what they needed .
[B] I work ,
[A] Do you get , do you work at home all the time
[A] or just ,
[B] Well , no ,
[B] I worked for this company before I had my first daughter ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things ,
[B] so .
[A] Oh , that , that was , that worked out pretty good then .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it did .
[B] You know , I do n't do , I do n't really do n't do basic , a lot of what I used to do ,
[B] I just do , you know , something really minor
[B] but ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] it 's something that nobody else wants to do ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and it 's time consuming .
[B] So ,
[A] So , it keeps you in the company , huh ?
[B] That 's right , you know ,
[B] it gives me a paycheck , you know ,
[B] it 's only like the work 's only , you know , three weeks .
[B] Goes for like three to four weeks three times a year ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] you know , it 's not something that 's continual because , you know , the television ratings do n't come out , you know , all the time .
[B] They only come out four times a year ,
[B] so but .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Boy
[A] I tell you if I could bring a computer home and do stuff here , I 'd get all kinds of stuff done .
[B] Oh .
[A] Phone 's always ringing
[A] and ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] people always asking me to do something else .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I 've got a lot of ,
[A] especially right now , we 've got several new products coming out ,
[A] and I 've got lots of documentation I need to review and some I need to revise .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] will they let you take a computer home to work ?
[A] Well , yeah ,
[A] but , you know , I need to be at the office , too .
[B] Oh , uh-huh .
[A] You know , I 've just got to deal , with all those other things that happen
[A] but ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] a P C at the house would really take a lot of the load off .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I bet .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] my hu- , he took one home when they , when they had it , you know , they had a big deadline coming up
[B] and it was looking a little touchy to meet ,
[B] so .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] well , I 've , I 've done that before on , a couple times .
[B] Yeah .
[A] But that would make it just that much easier
[A] instead of bringing home a computer , you just bring home a few floppy disks , you know .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] that 's right .
[B] I thought that would be , you know ,
[B] because it 's real nice with this because I do n't even have to go into the office
[B] I 've maybe been into the office once in the past three years , you know .
[A] Oh , my .
[B] They just , um , they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever ,
[B] so , you know .
[A] Man that sounds really nice .
[B] Yeah .
[B] It is real nice , you know ,
[B] I just deal with them on the telephone ,
[B] half the people do n't even know who they 're talking to .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But I , you know , worked ,
[B] I know most of them , well ,
[B] I ca n't say that ,
[B] a lot of people changed around there
[B] but , most people know who I am ,
[B] but I do n't know who they are , you know .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] A lot of them just know me by name and phone voice .
[A] Right .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I 've got a lot of folks that I 've worked with like that as well .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] you just know them by the telephone ,
[B] so . But , well , it 's been good talking to you ,
[B] I think we 've MUMBLEx got the subject .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] we sort of stayed to the topic anyway .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] we tried .
[B] It 's hard to sometimes .
[A] Okay ,
[A] well , we 'll talk to you later .
[B] Okay , well , thanks ,
[B] bye , bye .
[A] Bye .
