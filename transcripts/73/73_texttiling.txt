[A] Okay .
[A] So , uh , what do you think about it ?
[B] Well , um , I guess I , I 'm more concerned about public safety than I am about the , um , the concern for the private , uh , the idea of ,
[A] Privacy .
[B] preserving privacy for ,
[A] Right .
[B] the individual , um ,
[B] because I ca n't really see why anyone , um , who has nothing to hide would object .
[A] Well , there is always the , uh , the possibility , even remote as it is , of , uh , of mistaken , uh , of ,
[B] That 's , of course , that is certainly true ,
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] yeah .
[A] And see that bothers me .
[A] I 'm , I 'm a , I mean , I 'm , I 'm very much for drug testing ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] uh , I really am .
[A] I mean , I 'm going , I 'm going to take the negative side just for a second ,
[B] Sure .
[A] just to do it .
[A] Um , see , I have to take , uh , medication for a , uh , for , for kidney transplant .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And I 'm going to be taking that the rest of my life .
[A] Now , you ,
[B] Sure .
[A] I do n't know how that 's going to affect , uh ,
[B] If you had to have a drug test ?
[A] Right .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I mean I have n't had one yet .
[A] Um , T I ,
[A] I work for Texas Instruments --
[B] Uh-huh ,
-----
[B] uh-huh .
[A] -- and , and , uh , we , you know , we do have the random drug testing
[A] but I 've missed it so far .
[A] But I mean , it , in the back of my mind , it always bothers me .
[A] And what happens if it , you know , if it , if they catch it ,
[A] they think that I 'm , you know , I 'm on drugs
[A] and they send me and , and have me , uh , you know , go through this , this ,
[B] Checked out or whatever .
[A] thing , you know ,
[A] yeah .
[B] But it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that . Um ,
[B] I agree that , that some innocent person might be victimized ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] by a false test ,
[B] but I would think that , um , that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that .
[B] For example , that one , uh , positive would not be , uh , accepted as an automatic , um , reason for whatever they might be going ,
[A] Right .
-----
[B] to do if they found a positive , uh , dismissal or treatment or whatever , but that , that what it would do is it would trigger , perhaps , uh , one or two more stages where further tests could be ta- , uh , done .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Because , um , there are , there must be people like you , or in other circumstances , that could come up with , with , uh , false positives for certain kind of drugs .
[B] On the other hand , um , I think there 's certainly some professions that ought to be tested --
[A] Oh , yeah .
-----
[B] -- because of the , of their responsibility for the public welfare , and certainly people in , uh , industries , well , the transportation industry ,
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] for spe- , uh , you know , specifically .
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] But , um , in many , many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs , it 's not even going to effect anybody but his , uh , you know , himself and his own family , perhaps , um , depending on the kind of drug he might be on .
[A] Right .
[B] But , um , and eventually that 's going to show up anyway in the way he works ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and so on .
[B] But there 's so many things that it would make a difference .
[B] I guess I , I , uh , I would not want to have anyone in my family , uh , victimized by someone who , you know , a , a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that , who , um , you know , had n't been tested .
[A] Right .
-----
[A] Well , I , you know , I 'm , like I said , I 'm , I 'm very much pro testing , um ,
[A] and , and this is why .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Uh , number one is I , I 'm , I 'm kind of ,
[A] I know this sounds like a slogan for the government ,
[A] but I , you know , we are in a war against ,
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] drugs .
[A] I mean --
[B] Sure .
[A] -- it 's , it 's horrible .
[A] I mean , you do n't know whether the person sitting next to you --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- anywhere is on drugs or not ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and it takes some drastic steps at this point .
[A] And I think , personally , the drastic step has to be that , um , that you ca n't work if you continue taking drugs .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I mean , it 's as simple as that .
[A] I mean , make it so ,
[B] Make it difficult enough .
[A] Well , make it , uh , ma- , not necessarily difficult ,
[A] but make it so that it 's not glamorous .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] I mean , it 's glamorous taking drugs ,
[A] or at least it seems that way .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] according to what you ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] you hear .
[B] The people who , um , have serious problems , I mean ,
[B] we have , um ,
[B] really I guess we 're kind of lucky .
[B] We really only know of one , uh , young man who , uh , who 's a fam- ,
[B] they go to our church ,
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] and it 's the son and so on ,
[B] and he was friends with my children um ,
[B] and he 's really the only one that I know of personally who got himself really messed up , um , ha , having been involved with drugs .
[B] But I know of a number of other people who have , you know , gotten all messed up .
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] Most of these are young people .
[B] I work in the education system
[B] and so I have a little more contact with that .
[B] But , um , the effect that it 's had on this young man 's life is so dramatic that it 's heartbreaking --
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] -- and he may never really be a productive member of society .
[B] But sadder than that , he may never be able to have a normal , happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are , are almost uncontrollable .
[B] I mean , he , he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that , you know , he , he 's not sure if he 's going try to commit suicide or not .
[A] Huh .
-----
[B] I mean , he 's , you know , he 's so messed up .
[A] Right .
[B] And , um , this was a nice , sweet , young man who , teenager , you know ,
[B] and he 's now a young man about twenty , I guess , who , um , just got really down the wrong path .
[A] Right .
[B] And , uh , you know , I do n't know that , that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing .
[B] But seeing what drugs did to him makes me see , makes me realize what it could do to people , you know , in the work force as well .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Um , it 's horrible .
[A] Well , then ,
[A] let 's , let 's answer the second half of the question .
[A] What limits ought to be put on it , do you think ?
[B] Well , the limits , uh , uh , would , I think , have to do with what I 'd alluded to before , that there needs to be a further , um , that , that one positive on a drug test ,
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] would not constitute , uh , dismissal or grounds for whatever the company or agency might , uh , have set up for those who genuinely have a problem .
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] In other words , there needs to be , um , more than ,
[A] Treatment before for dismissal type thing .
[B] Pard- ,
[B] yes ,
[B] right ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] there needs to be more than one test ,
[B] and there needs to be some , some measure of , uh , certainty before anything drastic happens .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] There are lots of things that are involved there , um , such as , perhaps , insurance --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- uh , you know , denial of insurance for someone , um ,
[B] and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this , um , that would , that , you know ,
[B] it would be unfair ,
[B] and people who are on medication , for example , or , um , even people who might be of the gay community ,
[B] and I 'm not an advocate for that particular segment of society ,
[B] but , um , I think that there does n't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination --
[A] Right .
[B] because it makes a bigger problem . Um ,
[B] so it seems to me that , that , um , there needs to be some ground , you know , some rules --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- that protect .
[B] I 'm not sure , though , when we talk about what rules , if any , that we should say , well , certain segments should not have to be tested .
[B] I really do n't see why ,
[A] Personally , I think that 's what I was about to say --
[B] And , yeah .
[A] -- is that everyone needs to be tested .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I do n't ,
[A] It , you know ,
[B] I do n't know why it would be , you know , uh , bad to test just every- ,
[B] and it may be , you know ,
[B] it 's not feasible to do everyone ,
[B] but certainly random testing , the fact that people know that , that they ,
[A] That it could happen .
[B] Yeah ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] would be some measure of protection .
[B] But the bottom line is that , that if , if you 're going to stay clean and straight , then , um , you 're , you 're going to do that because you want to .
[A] Right .
[B] Really .
[A] Well , there 's , yeah , there , there 's going to be some measure of incentive , uh , reward or whatever ,
[A] but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So I , I 've got to agree with that .
[A] So , um ,
[B] That 's very true .
[A] Um .
[B] Well , it sounds like we agree , anyway .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I think so .
[A] I think we , I think we did pretty good .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Well , all right ,
[A] well , uh , I guess that 's about it .
[B] I guess if that 's all we 've done
[B] and I guess we 've talked long enough .
[A] All right .
[B] It was nice talking to you .
[A] It was , it was talk , nice talking to you , too .
[B] Okay ,
[B] bye-bye .
[A] All right ,
[A] bye-bye .
