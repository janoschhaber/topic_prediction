[A] Okay ,
[A] what do you like to cook ?
[B] I like , well I like to cook foods I like to eat .
[B] I like to eat Italian food best .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And I find that I , that 's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one dish meals , type things and ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] they 're kind of convenient .
[A] That would be good for a dinner party , that , you know , to cook that because you do n't have to deal with eight different things ,
[B] Right .
[A] coming out at once .
[A] Is that what you usually cook when you have a party .
[B] Um , I usually have parties that are smaller groups .
[B] I do n't have , I 've never had a real big dinner party except at traditional holidays like Thanksgiving and such .
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] And so , um , yeah ,
[B] I guess I usually do .
[B] I like to cook , um , heavy sauces , and , um ,
[A] Really ,
[A] that sounds good .
[B] noodles and pasta and such .
[A] Um , fattening .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] actually .
[B] How about you ,
[B] what do you like to , to cook ?
[A] Uh , we ,
[A] it 's funny that , um , we 're talking about this ,
[A] we just had a dinner party
[A] and we had , um ,
[A] our senior pastor and his wife came over .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And I catered to their diet is the only thing , though ,
[A] so it was n't something I really wanted to make .
[A] I really wanted to make red beans and rice and with MUMBLEx .
[B] Oh yeah .
-----
[A] you know , sausage ,
[A] because I 'm from New Orleans originally .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , um , I was going to make that , red beans and rice with the , those Cajun sausage and French bread with garlic butter and stuff ,
[A] and , uh , well there 's salad
[A] and then for desert I would , I really wanted to make , um , just brownies
[A] or French donuts would have been good ,
[A] but it 's real hard to make them .
[A] They do n't really come out like they do in New Orleans , up here ,
[A] I do n't know why .
[B] Oh really .
-----
[A] I do n't know if it 's me or the water or the recipe I have
[A] but ,
[B] Humidity or something .
[A] um , that 's what I want .
[A] That 's what I like to make is just real neat stuff like that
[A] but .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Kind of like the Italian ,
[A] it 's really good ,
[A] but instead I catered to their diet
[A] so I made baked chicken in the crock pot
[A] and , um , it was good and everything ,
[A] it had all the vegetables in it ,
[A] but , it seemed kind of boring compared ,
[B] It kind of , uh , kind of down played compared to what you would like , huh .
-----
[A] Right .
[B] Do you find yourself , um , with all the , um , cholesterol and , and high fiber changing the way that you fi , that you entertain ?
[A] I find it changing the way that I eat , but not the way I entertain ,
-----
[A] because I guess , I guess I feel like if they 're on a diet like that , I 'm going to , you know , honor that ,
[A] but if it 's just
[A] another couple came , um , over a couple weeks later
[A] and I made ,
[A] what did I make that night .
[A] I made a roast ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and I made , um , uh ,
[A] I ca n't believe this
[A] my husband broke the coffee pot I just bought yesterday .
[B] Oh no .
[A] I ca n't believe that .
[A] Anyway , but I asked ,
[A] when Ricky and Carrie came over we made , um , a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit .
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] And normally I , do n't eat , we do n't eat like that during the week because of the , you know , the calories and the fat in it .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] But you know , when we 're having guests , we just kind of say , oh just do it .
[A] And I made blueberry cobbler
[A] and we had extra crust with it ,
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] it was so fattening .
[B] That sounds good .
[A] But , I do n't think we gained any weight from it
[A] so .
[B] Well , every once in a while I , I think I feel the same way .
[B] When I 'm entertaining , I do n't take that thing into consideration unless it 's really , really ,
[B] like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it 's too rich simply because they do n't want the extra calories ,
[B] so I think dessert is the only thing that I kind of down play , sometimes .
[A] Right ,
[A] I made an apple pan downy when the pastor and his wife came over
[A] and she did n't eat it .
[B] Oh yeah .
[A] But I did bake apples so that it would be , not brownies , you know .
[A] I figured there was less calories in apple pan downy than in fudge brownies .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] So , um , I 've read a good brownie recipe .
[B] Oh , that 's good .
[A] But , uh , anyway , so I guess that 's about what I did when I entertained .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] So , do you have anything else you want to say about it ?
[B] Um , nothing comes to mind right off ,
[B] so I guess not .
[A] Okay ,
[A] well it was nice talking to you .
[B] Okay
[B] you too .
[A] Okay ,
[A] bye .
[B] Bye , bye .
