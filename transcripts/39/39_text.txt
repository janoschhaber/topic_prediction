[A] Yeah ,
[A] the question was , uh , what kind of books do you read for entertainment , uh , uh , I guess ,
[B] Oh , I just read for escape .
[A] Okay .
[B] Well , I mean it 's ,
[A] With two little kids I can understand that .
[B] Yes .
[B] It 's that 's simple .
[B] I read to escape ,
[B] and I do n't read any PARENTS magazines either .
[A] Oh .
[B] So .
[A] What , uh , what kind of ,
[B] Well , I just finished , just , I just finished one last night . A great book .
[B] It , it 's very , a typical for my reading though but a great book , one called , THE THINGS THEY CARRIED by Tim O'Brien .
[A] Huh .
[B] And it 's , uh ,
[B] God
[B] I do n't know if I would call it a collection of Vietnam war stories or if I 'd call it a collection of Vietnam love stories .
[A] Oh .
[B] Strange book . Beautifully written .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Just beautifully written .
[A] By , uh , somebody who was there
[A] or ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] a guy who was there as a , uh , foot soldier .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] So , he considered himself to be , you know , a , a true Vietnam soldier .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Well , any of the guys that were ground MUMBLEx
[A] yes .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I can imagine .
[B] Yeah .
[B] So , what 's the latest one you 've read ?
[A] Well , I tell you what ,
[A] I 'm a kind of , uh , a history nut .
[A] I 'm trying to think back now ,
[A] I read an awful lot of , uh , periodicals and , uh , you know , almost what you call reference books .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , uh , the last , uh , I 'm embarrassed to say the last , you know , honest to gosh , cover to cover book that I read , I can not , right offhand , I tried to read , uh , one of the , the Michener , uh , LONE STAR or the , the TEXAS HISTORY BOOK .
[B] I have never been able to make it through any of Michener 's work .
[A] Oh , well , I 've had similar problems .
[A] It does tend to , to ,
[B] Have you , are you a Civil War buff at all ?
[A] Yeah , as a matter of fact ,
[A] yeah .
[B] Because I finished one ,
[B] I think this is like two years ago ,
[B] and somebody had given me one of these dinky do , crappy women 's novels set in the Civil War , John Jakes with ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and the novel did n't do that much for me .
[B] But , boy , the period of time was fascinating .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] So , I then read , was it BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] or ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] I think it was BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM .
[A] BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM .
[B] It 's kind of like a historical compendium ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] of the Civil War ,
[B] and it 's not a story of the Civil War ,
[B] it 's a story of all the politics and , uh , lobbying and just basically state by state events ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] that lead to the events that brought about the Civil War .
[B] And it 's fascinating because I had always , you know , been raised on this , you know , Emancipation Proclamation with the Civil War .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] There was a lot more to it than that , were n't there ?
[B] There was a lot more to it than that .
[B] As a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well , it was a political move .
[B] Oh , yeah .
[A] It was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because , you know , it was , uh , if you read it , it only emancipated those who were in areas , uh , in rebellion against the United States .
[A] All the other areas which would , I think at that time would have included West Virginia and , oh , may have been Kentucky , a few states , you know , that were not part of the South but still had slaves .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] They did n't emancipate them .
[B] Well , you know what else really surprised me , now
[B] I 'm married to a native Texan
[B] and I 'm not .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Uh ,
[A] I 've got the same problem .
[B] yeah ,
[B] I 'm glad you put it that way .
[B] And I have two native Texan children too .
[A] Yeah .
[B] My husband is always , you know , talked about th- , Texas being a , uh , rebel state .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , oh , my God , all this Civil War pride .
[B] I kept waiting for ,
[B] where 's some reference to this goddamn State of Texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the Civil War .
[A] Mayb- ,
[A] is n't much there , was there ?
[B] They might as well have not even been there .
[A] Right .
[B] You know , they were n't a state
[B] and the only , the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to , you know , who 's going to be going there .
[B] And I keep telling my husband that ,
[B] and he keeps saying , oh , no .
[B] I thought , okay .
[A] They supplied some , uh , you know ,
[A] they were some groups of it , the Vicksburg ,
[A] if you ever get a chance to go over to Vicksburg , the battleground at Vicksburg , uh , there 's an area there where there was , uh , some Texas , uh , groups
[A] and they had an interesting time there .
[B] Oh , I 'll bet they did .
[A] And down there at Sabine Pass , uh , I ca n't think of the guy 's name
[A] but he held off , uh , you know , just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole Union navy for a while from coming up the Sabine River which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story .
[B] Well , you know , why they actually held them off ?
[B] None of the Yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar .
[A] That could be it , could be it .
[B] Now , you did n't hear me say that .
[B] Outside of , uh ,
[A] And then the last Civil War battle was fought at Val Verde , you know ,
[A] over there on the Texas border you had a lot of , of groups heading for Mexico
[A] and they were cut off at the pass more or less , at Eagle Pass .
[A] And they did n't get across the river there
[A] so they 're , the last ,
[A] and that was actually after the war was over
[A] but it was the last ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] organized battle between the two units was in Texas ,
[A] so .
[B] Oh .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] Texas participation in the Civil War was , uh , minor at , uh ,
[A] it 's been ,
[B] Boy ,
[B] do n't tell that to a native Texan though ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] I mean , my god , they fought and won the whole thing .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well , my wife 's from Galveston ,
[A] so .
[B] Oh .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Well , I 'm from New Mexico
[A] so , you know , I was ,
[B] That 's a beautiful state .
[B] That 's a beautiful state .
[B] See I was raised in the Midwest which ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] you know , hell , we did n't even , you know , we did n't even know where the Mason Dixon Line was ,
[B] and besides , you know , if corn did n't grow there ,
[A] Huh .
[B] it did n't matter .
[A] It sounds like Iowa or something .
[B] Iowa and Nebraska .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Yep .
[B] And then I had probably lived the last eleven years in Massachusetts
[B] so , you know .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] What does that make me , an honorary Yankee
[B] or ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] on ,
[A] yeah .
[B] God knows what .
[A] Oh , well , my sister 's living in Illinois right now ,
[A] so .
[B] Well then , she 's going to come out well rounded .
[A] Yeah .
[B] But outside of those kind of things , you know , the other thing that I 've really gotten into reading ,
[B] and I think this is because the kids are getting to me ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] is science fiction .
[A] I 've always kind of enjoyed it .
[A] I , I used to read a lot more than I do now .
[B] Well , I 've gone to the point where my husband , my husband travels , I get out like , you know , two or three books .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And I , I 'm trying to think of , oh , Isaac Asimov , ROBOT series .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I mean , I think I 've read all four of them
[B] and I understand that there 's a fifth .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] In the last six weeks he 's been on the road a lot .
[A] I just turned around and looked at my brief , at my briefcase , my , uh , bookcase up here
[A] and I see ARMAGEDDON up there .
[A] And , uh , the SHADOW OF BLOOMING GROVE and TWO THOUSAND AND TEN and GRANT TAKES COMMAND and THE WAR IN THE YEAR , oh , SPACE MUMBLEx that was the one I was trying to wade through was SPACE , James Michener . Did n't get very far on that .
[B] You know , I think I read HAWAII ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] when I was about ten years old
[B] or so .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Which is about the developmental level that , you know , you need to be at to read those things ,
[B] and I still even then I was so , so disgusted with it I , I tried to read , I do n't remember which other one it was ,
[B] whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And I just , I got about like a hundred pages through it and realized I had like a thousand more ,
[B] I thought , I ca n't do this .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it really
[A] the , the books are kind of , uh , imposing to say the least .
[B] Yeah .
[A] No ,
[A] let 's see ,
[A] here 's one called GHOST TOWNS AND MINING CAMPS OF NEW MEXICO
[A] now , not too many people have read that one
[A] I do n't think .
[B] No .
[A] And there 's THE HISTORY OF YOAKUM COUNTY , TEXAS there .
[A] I 've got , uh ,
[B] Is that a big , thick book ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] and I 've got , yeah , and I 've got a HISTORY OF KINGSLEY , IOWA .
[B] What the , what the hell for ?
[B] Why Kingsley , Iowa ?
[A] Well , because that 's where my folks all came from .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] And they had a centennial here awhile back .
[A] I read the GRANT TAKES COMMAND ,
[A] that was pretty good .
[B] Well ,
[A] That was part of that trilogy that , uh ,
[B] Now that 's one that ,
[A] Bruce Canton did .
[B] That 's one
[B] I do n't know .
[B] See , I had never really been into science fiction that much until , uh , somebody gave me MIST OF AVALON probably about five or six years ago .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I do n't know if I 'd call it science fiction or fantasy .
[A] Sometimes it 's awful hard ,
[A] some of those get very philosophical
[A] they can be in any setting ,
[A] they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting , you know ,
[A] the ,
[B] Well , I loved that novel .
[B] And then somebody said , oh , God , this would have been even long ago because I was in Boston
[B] and it was raining all night ,
[B] and I had a hole in my roof
[B] and I was waiting for the whole house to collapse ,
[B] and , uh , I was reading DUNE .
[A] Oh .
[B] Which seeming rather ironic .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And I read the whole damn book while I was home hauling out , you know , like ten-gallon buckets of , of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and ,
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] you 're reading DUNE .
[B] reading about these guys wearing their little free man still suits
[B] and ,
[B] I think that 's probably my favorite of , of any piece of science fiction that I 've ever read .
[A] That was a movie too , was n't it ?
[B] And the movie was awful .
[A] Was it ?
[B] Oh , yes ,
[B] it was just terrible .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I 'd , I did n't see it
[A] but , uh ,
[A] yeah .
[B] It was , it was beyond , uh ,
[A] Patrick Stewart was in that .
[A] I guess the guy that 's on the new STAR TREK series was in that thing , uh .
[B] I do n't know ,
[B] I just remember Sting was in it .
[A] Oh , really ? .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] and if you were trying to follow any type of , uh , plot , it , it total- ,
[B] even having read the book , and I 've read that book probably three times ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] watching that movie , I could n't figure out ,
[A] Could n't ,
[B] what they were talking about ,
[B] at all .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I was real disappointed in that .
[B] Well , I 'll tell you another good book ,
[B] do you like scary things ?
[A] Um , well , some history ,
[B] Have you ,
[A] books are pretty scary ,
[A] but ,
[A] yeah .
[B] That 's true .
[B] Have you read , THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS ?
[A] No .
[A] Somebody who ,
[B] Oh .
[A] saw the movie here the other day told me it was the most terrifying thing they 'd ever seen ,
[A] they did n't sleep all night .
[B] Well , see I , I am debating whether or not I want to go see the movie after having read the book .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I mean the book is , is chilling .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I have ,
[B] Just chilling .
[A] no , uh ,
[A] I do n't have the foggiest notion what it 's about ,
[A] so .
[B] Then I wo n't tell you .
[A] Okay ,
[A] yeah .
[A] But ,
[B] It 's just that if you 're ever , ever really want to just be scared out of your wits ,
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] that 's the one .
[B] That 's the one .
[B] Yes .
[A] Even better than JAWS and some of that ?
[B] Yes ,
[B] because the cat- , the , the character that is so horrible is another human being .
[B] And you 're just drawn into his , his horror ,
[B] of him that you ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] begin to kind of like him .
[A] Oh .
[B] I mean ,
[A] A , a Freddy Kruger type , huh ?
[B] No ,
[B] no .
[B] This guy 's smart
[B] and he 's suave
[B] and he 's all the charac- , all the ,
[A] Oh the worst kind ,
[A] yeah ,
[B] characteristics ,
[A] yeah .
[B] yeah ,
[B] all the characteristics ...
