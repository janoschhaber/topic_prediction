[A] Okay , um , well ,
-----
[A] the first thing ,
[A] uh , what do you think you would offer as far as , uh , information about selecting a school ?
[B] Well , first I think they 've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to , what they want to do .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Uh , once they have that , then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves , and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind of , uh , of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer .
[A] Yeah , uh ,
[A] do you , do you feel that the first two years that the , um ,
[A] depending upon the field , I know there are some fields which a person should go to the school , that school , all four years ,
[A] but I know there are some fields where it 's really not necessary .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] a lot fields are ,
-----
[B] most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff are n't really concerned with your first two years anyway .
[B] It 's , it 's your core education , your general requi- , general education requirements .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Um , if , you know , if they want to get a liberal arts degree , I do n't , I do n't know what advice I 'd give them .
[B] Go to the school you 'd like to go to .
[A] Yeah .
[B] That 's what I did .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I did n't care about the program or anything else .
[B] I went where I wanted to go .
[A] Yeah .
[A] What was your degree in ?
-----
[B] Uh , political science .
[A] Political science , oh ,
[A] okay .
[A] Well , I kn , I know , I 'm going to school right now ,
[A] and , uh , I have a friend ,
[B] Where are you at ?
[A] Uh , U T D .
[A] University of Texas , Dallas .
[B] Well , yeah ,
-----
[B] I guess , everybody 's in Dallas that I talk to .
[B] I 'm in ,
[A] I know .
[B] North Carolina .
-----
[A] That 's where Texas Instruments is .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] right .
[A] Um , something that I , I think that I 've noticed that
[A] I , I have a friend ,
[A] I think if you 're going into like , uh , law or medicine , a very particular , very specific field , even , even engineering , you can get , you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public , um , institution .
[B] Sure .
[A] And , uh , it 's a lot cheaper .
[B] Oh , yeah .
[A] My parents , my parents made a mistake in , uh , in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years .
[B] Um .
[A] And she found out after that ,
[A] she said , you know , my parents , they just , they really wasted a lot of money .
[A] This is about twenty years ago .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] But , uh , well , right now I just ,
[A] I mean as far as selecting , selecting a school , I , I , I feel that , uh , a lot of it depends upon the major .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it does . Um ,
[B] I did n't know what I wanted to do after I got my , my degree .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Um , originally I had planned , uh , undergrad degree in political science and then a master 's in public administration .
[B] And I went ahead and pursued that .
[B] I , I got as far as the thesis , and decided , To hell with it ,
[B] I did n't want it .
[B] Um , and from that point I went to law school .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And after a year and a half of that I decided I did n't want that either .
[A] Okay .
[B] Have n't figured out what I want to be when I grow up .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And so , but I , I , I really did enjoy the law .
[B] I mean , that 's , that 's where I wanted to be ,
[B] but I did n't want to go through the , uh , the hassle that the law schools put you through , because I never did want to be a practicing attorney .
-----
[B] I just wanted a law degree .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And I 've since discovered that I would be far better off being in the paralegal field .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Because that 's the nuts and bolts of the law , and that 's what I like ,
[B] and you do n't have to put up with all the B S that the lawyers have to .
[A] Right .
[B] So that 's , that 's what I 'm pursuing right now --
[A] Um .
[B] -- and I 'm pretty happy with it so far .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] I 'm , I 'm pursuing what they , what 's , what 's called an interdisciplinary field .
[A] I 'm a speech therapy major --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and fortunately I have a lot of , I have a good medical background ,
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] and ,
[B] that 's probably very useful .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it 's , it 's actually turning out to be more , more useful than what I thought .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , um , I also have a good languages background , linguistics .
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And some psychology .
[A] So , it 's all working together .
[B] Yeah .
[A] The only field I 'm not familiar with really is education , which is required , MUMBLEx requires about four or five different fields --
[B] Oh , good grief .
[A] -- really .
-----
[A] So it 's a ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I thought at one time I wanted to be a teacher ,
[B] but I , I quickly dispelled that idea when I became a substitute teacher for a while , just to get my feet wet .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I said , uh , I could n't do this everyday .
[B] No way .
-----
[A] Well .
[B] Maybe , maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing , but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing .
[A] Oh , so you are a disgruntled graduate student .
[B] I am a dis , I am , I am just a disgruntled person all around .
-----
[A] Oh .
[B] I 'm the , uh , I 'm the , uh , original , uh , Mister Scrooge , I guess .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] Bah , humbug .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] bah , humbug .
-----
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I just ,
[A] I , I , I think ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] there is ,
[A] I , I , I think , uh , law would be a fine field , a fine profession , fine field to go into .
[A] Um , I know one time I was in a political science class ,
[A] and you know , talking about fields , people going into different fields , I made an off , off the cuff remark about lawyers ,
[A] about their integrity being questionable .
[A] And I mean , oh , that was like a can of worms .
[B] Probably , you probably got everybody on you , because they were probably all going to law school .
[A] No ,
[A] there was a woman ,
[A] she said My , my best friends are lawyers and you know , all this ,
[A] and it was just .
[B] Well , that remark in itself is a slam .
-----
[B] My best friends are lawyers .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I know .
[B] You know , like , like , uh , my best friends are blacks .
-----
[A] Or Jewish ,
[A] it used to be Jewish , you know .
[B] Jewish ,
[B] now blacks --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and I guess , I , I , guess Iraqi now is the .
-----
[A] I know ,
[A] it 's ,
[A] but ,
[B] Law , law was a lot of fun until you get to law school --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and it does n't become fun anymore .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I have a I have a friend .
[A] She 's studying , she 's going into law ,
[A] another friend going into law ,
[A] and , she 's ,
-----
[A] I , I , I 'm really , I 'm really concerned about , you know ,
[A] she 's just going to be , you know ,
[A] what 's going to happen when she gets there .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] you going ,
-----
[A] You know , all of her dreams will be dispelled .
[B] Oh , yeah .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] if , if , if you 've ever seen the program PAPER CHASE --
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- it 's very much like that , except worse .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it 's I , I think it 's probably more embarrassing and very painful .
[B] It is .
[A] I see --
-----
[B] Yeah ,
[B] very much so .
[A] -- I see that happening .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it 's , it 's a lot of that . Um --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- it , it was enjoyable for a while , um ,
[B] but it 's such a grind --
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and you begin to wonder , you know ,
[B] if , if I 'm not , I mean ,
[B] you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer to do it .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] If you have any doubts whatsoever , you better not get into it .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I mean , I wasted a year and a half of awfully hard ,
[B] and I aged ten years .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But I , I , I would n't trade the experience for anything in the world .
[B] It never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I went to a language school ,
[A] and , and that was a , it was a , an un- , I guess , uh , United States institution .
-----
[A] I was military at the time .
[A] And I , I think --
[B] What branch were you in ?
-----
[A] -- probably the biggest .
[A] Huh ?
[B] What branch were you in ?
[A] I was in the Air Force ?
-----
[B] I was too .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] for myself , I mean , I think that military experience was fine ,
[A] it was just , I just wish that there was something else that , that , that I could have done , you know , with ,
[B] Well , I got , I got tired of the service after a while , I mean
[B] it ,
[B] I had a terrific job , really enjoyed it .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] what , what was your job ?
[B] Uh , command post .
[A] Uh , I was , I was a linguist .
-----
[B] I was just wondering , were you in SAC by any chance ? .
[A] Um .
[B] Were you in SAC ?
[A] In Tak ?
-----
[B] SAC .
[A] Uh , no
[A] I was n't .
[B] Oh , okay ,
[B] I , I thought maybe you might have had some experience with the , uh , R C one thirty-fives .
[A] No ,
[A] no ,
[A] I did n't , I did n't go flight crew .
[A] Matter of fact , I did n't make it completely through that , through that field .
[A] I , was in intelligence school and about three weeks short .
[B] Oh .
[A] I did n't make it ,
[A] I sort of washed out .
[B] Well ,
[B] Well .
[A] Yeah
[A] after about eighteen months of talking about the --
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- year and a half training , you know , it 's , it 's something , you know ,
[A] I think that 's why , you know , children really need to think about the field they 're going to , going into , and I mean , spend a lot of serious --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- reading before they , I mean , not just --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- thinking about .
[A] They actually should do some reading --
[B] That 's right ,
-----
[B] and it ,
[A] -- and they should study it .
[B] And if it 's possible even get some experience at it or at least watch some people --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- do it .
-----
[A] I , I , I , I think , I think there 's a lot to be said for kids working --
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] sure .
[A] -- after school .
[A] I mean , they , they find out whether , just how much of a people person they are .
[B] That 's true ,
-----
[B] I found that out when I was in high school .
[B] I worked at McDonald 's .
[A] Oh , and I tell you what ,
-----
[A] I worked at McDonald 's as well ,
[A] and I , I can tell you one thing ,
[A] there are just some people that I , you know ,
[A] you just came to the point where I mean ,
[A] and oh , I eventually worked in a lab , in a la- , as a lab technician ,
[A] and I worked front desk .
[A] And I mean , somebody could walk in the door ,
[A] and I knew exactly what they were going to do and say .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah
[B] I was the same way too .
[B] I 'm not a people person .
[B] I , I , I hate , um , having to play such a nice guy .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] You know , especially when it 's all phony .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Especially when you got some , uh , jerk coming in .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I ,
[B] it 's just not for me .
[B] I 'm , uh , I deal much better in research and books , and stuff like that --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- which is why I 'm going to enjoy the paralegal field a lot .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's good .
[A] I was just wondering , um , getting back to the school thing , so , I , I almost wish that there was something ...
