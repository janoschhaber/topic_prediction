[A] I 've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something ,
[B] Yeah
[A] but , uh ,
[B] I was one of the forced ones .

[A] but I , I 'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music --
[B] Oh , I could never do that .
[A] -- and ,
-----
[B] I was never that brave
[B] but , uh , yeah .

[A] dancer , uh ,
-----
[A] I ca n't think of her name .
[A] I got it right on the tip of my tongue and ca n't say it , Helen something .

[A] real long legs ,
[B] she 's got black hair ,
[A] and dark hair .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] okay ,
[B] I know who you 're talking about .
-----
[B] I ca n't think ever her name either .
[A] I ca n't think of it .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that wa , that was , that was ,
[B] I remember that being , uh , here a few years ago .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[B] 
[A] but , uh ,
[B] Oh , oh , the last country music ,
[B] my , my parents still , uh , really like country ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] music
[B] and they , they like , uh , they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Statler Brothers ,
[A] Oh , yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[B] and , and , uh , well , my , my , my ,
[A] The Blackwoods .
[B] my parents ,
-----
[B] yeah ,
[B] my husband likes , uh , country music real well
[B] and he , he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and , yeah ,
[B] he really likes Shenandoah .
[A] Alabama .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] well , yeah ,
[B] Alabama ,
[A] Uh ,
[B] I think , I think they 're a bit over exposed .
[A] Yeah
[B] I get kind ,
[A] MUMBLEx .
[B] of tire , get tir , tired of every other song being Alabama on the ,
[A] Yeah ,
[B] radio .
[A] either Alabama or Hank Williams , Junior .
[B] Oh , I , I 've never cared for Hank ,
[A] I never have either ,
[B] Williams , Junior .
-----
[A] and I never have figured out how he won , uh , entertainer of the year for about ,
[B] Oh .
[A] three or four years in a row .
[B] Oh , we , we watch those award shows too ,
[B] we enjoy watching the country and the Grammies and stuff
-----
[B] but I just , I just do n't care for him ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] I just never have .
[B] I do n't ,
[A] I guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is , uh , probably Eddy Arnold .
[B] Is , is it ?
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Okay ,
[B] I , I think , I , I know who that is ,
[B] uh-huh .
[B] I think my parents have have , uh , some of his records .
[A] But , uh ,
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] I got a , I 've got about a hundred and , or had a , uh , some , uh , I sold some of them , I had about a hundred and fifty old seventy-eight R P M records of country and western ,
[B] Wow .
[A] songs ,
[A] Smiley Burnette , I do n't know if you were old enough to remember him him .
[B] I 've heard the name .
[A] He was , uh , played in the old western movies .
-----
[A] He was the sidekick of Gene Autry I believe --
[B] Huh .
[A] -- or they ,
[A] I think his name in , in the movie was Froggy
[A] and ,
[B] I 've , I 've never seen a Gene Autry movie ,
[A] had a real raspy voice ,
[B] Huh .
[A] and , uh ,
[B] No ,
[B] I never have .
[A] some of those old ones , of course , Bob Wills , Miss Texas Playboys --
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- Ernest Tubbs and Red Foley an ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] those go back quite a way .
[A] Yeah .
[A] I took them up here to Collectors Rector- , Records and was able to get a little money for them --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- but , uh ,
-----
[B] It 's hard to ,
[A] my m- , mother and dad use to , uh , own a restaurant ,
[B] Oh , yeah .
-----
[A] and he had , uh , they had a , uh , nickelodeon , of course , in the restaurant ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] and when they would come and change the records the guys would , the guy would give her the old records --
[B] Well , that wou ,
-----
[B] that 's neat .
[A] -- so , that 's where I got my ,
[B] that would be gr , great if they were n't too worn out ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] at the time .
[A] Of course , there 's not a whole lot of market for seventy-eight R P M records .
[B] Is there not ?
-----
[B] You , you 'd , well you 'd think there would be .
[A] Well , the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because ,
[B] Well , that 's true .
[A] you have to have that needle , that , uh , particular kind of needle --
[B] Oh , yeah .
[A] -- and , uh , they ,
[B] 
[A] just wo n't play on a modern day , uh --
[B] Well , that 's a shame --
[A] -- phonograph .
-----
[B] -- because I , I , we go to antique stores a lot
[B] and you see seventy-eights ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] a , a lot at , at the stores , a- , a- , at record stores ,
[B] you 'd ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] think there 'd be a market for ,
[B] I 'm , I 'm sure you could find old players for them
[B] but that would cost a fortune ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] if you could find them that worked .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Oh .
[A] Of course , they , you know , just do n't have the quality of records nowadays either because ,
[B] No .
[A] you , you get that scratchy sound .
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Well , those things were big and thick were n't they ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[B] You could kill somebody with them .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] th- ,
[A] warped real easy .
-----
[B] And the ones you buy ,
[B] go out and buy one now
[B] and they 're just so thin and ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] flimsy
[B] and they just , they 're not meant to last ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] at all ,
[B] ne- , neither are tapes .
[B] I , I bu , we buy cassette tapes ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and machines will eat them ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and so , the best bet , any , anymo- , these days are compact disk ,
[B] those things are practically indestructible .
[A] But , I , I guess , you know , the old country and western music you ,
-----
[A] back then when I was a kid , there was n't that much T V ,
[B] Oh , no .
[A] so that 's all you had to listen to was the ,
-----
[B] Radio .
[A] radio ,
[A] and , uh ,
[B] Tha- , that 's just what , just what you had ,
[B] we- ,
[B] plus ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] I think it was better back then to ,
[B] th- , there 's too much T V now --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and the radio is , you know , more exciting ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] really , than , than television ,
[B] kep- ,
[B] your imagination --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- i- , i- , kept
[B] and yo- ,
[B] it just did n't vegetate your mind like television does .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I remember mother and dad always turned on the Grand Ole Opera .
[B] Oh , yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Was it on the radio every week ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] Wha , what day , what day was that on ,
-----
[B] do you , ha- , can you recall .
[A] Uh , uh , seems like it was on a Friday ,
[B] Uh .
