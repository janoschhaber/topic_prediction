[A] Where do you live ?
-----
[B] Uh , in the Houston area .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Well , I used to .
[A] I lived there for a long time .
-----
[A] But I 'm now in Palo Alto , California which is , I think , the recycling capital of the world .
[B] Oh , that 's great .
[A] So , we have many recycling activities
-----
[A] and I 'm , and in full , uh , support of all of them .
[B] Oh , we are too .
[B] Our community is , uh , just starting to get organized about it .
-----
[B] They just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our , our things and dump them off ourselves .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , uh , it ,
[A] Well , that 's something
-----
[A] but it , it seems to me that we 've gotten a whole lot better , um , cooperation out here , uh , by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra , uh ,
[A] actually I do n't think we pay very much extra at all too ,
[A] but the , uh , garbage men ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] come by , uh , on your regular garbage day and pick up the recycling out at the curb .
[B] I think that 's great .
[B] There 's a few places in Houston where they 're trying that out .
-----
[B] I do n't know if it 's , the , if they 've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded , uh , bags and , uh , bins .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] we have burlap sacks ,
[B] Oh .
[A] and they give us one for aluminum and , uh , steel , one for metals ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and one for glass ,
[A] and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags .
-----
[A] So , we have , we leave three little piles ,
[A] that they need out on the curb every Thursday
[A] and the garbage men come by and , uh , collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they 're still in good shape .
[B] Oh , that 's great .
[A] And , the , it really pays for itself because , oh , then the city ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] gets the money from the recycling .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] we 're , we 're all for it .
-----
[B] Our , um ,
[B] we 've got several bins in our , on , in our garage where we , uh , you know , sort things out and , and take it to , to the appropriate places .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] the one thing I wish we could recycle is magazines .
[A] But they claim that because of the way they 're bound they , uh , it 's too expensive to recycle them .
[A] At my office ,
[B] Yes .
[A] we have two big cardboard boxes in the library where everybody goes to pick up their mail ,
[A] and they 're , uh ,
[A] one 's for white paper
[A] and one 's for colored paper
[A] so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or so- ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] things like that goes in those boxes ,
[A] but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines ,
[A] and there 's no way to get rid of them .
[A] It just seems like such a waste .
[B] Oh , it does .
-----
[B] It does .
[B] But I 'm sure that they can , uh , find some sort of , uh , use for them if , you know , you know , there ,
[B] I 've seen talk about , uh , using garbage for , uh , energy .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And so , you know , you could also apply the magazines toward that .
[A] Well , that would be a help .
-----
[A] I wish they would do that here .
[A] We have got so little landfill space left that we 're going to run out before the end of this decade .
[B] Yes .
[A] And it 's really going to be a mess when they have to start hunting for places to put the things .
[B] Oh , I know it .
[A] We did have , uh , another novel , uh , experiment start this year .
[A] Now we can put all our yard clippings out .
[B] Oh .
[A] You can , you buy these super giant heavy-duty paper bags ,
[A] they 're about four-feet high .
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And you get them for I think it 's about fifty cents apiece at the grocery store you , um , usually buy them by the dozen .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And then you put all your lar- , yard clippings and , uh , leaf rakings and anything that will be compostible .
[B] Oh , uh-huh .
-----
[A] And those and they , the garbage men also pick those up on Thursdays .
[B] Oh , that 's great .
[A] And then the , uh , they take them to a special part of our dump where composting is now in full swing ,
[A] and at the end of every year , uh , they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flower beds .
[B] Right ,
[B] well , that 's a great idea .
[B] I wish we were that , uh , involved in , uh , or that our city was so involved in , that involved in recycling ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] like that
[B] because , you know , I 've talked to many people
[B] and we would n't mind going its extra effort to do it . Uh ,
[A] If they make it so that it 's not a horrendous inconvenience , I think most people would .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] oh , yeah . You know ,
-----
[B] and I do n't mind , you know ,
[B] at first it was the , the little extra money that you got , you know , returning the cans in and stuff like that .
[A] Right .
[B] But now , you know , I do n't mind as long as things are getting recycled , you know , that we do n't get reimbursed .
[A] No ,
[A] I think it 's , it 's , to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up ,
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] then to get that two cents when you take it to the store .
[B] Oh , I , oh , I know it .
[A] We still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] for cash .
-----
[A] But so few people , uh , have enough to make that worthwhile you 'd spend more in gas getting down there then you get back .
[B] Right .
[B] Yes .
[B] And then the , plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also .
[A] Now do the grocery stores in Houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags ?
-----
[B] We have ,
[B] I know of one that , the one that we use , uh , has , uh , recycling for the bags .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , uh , and they 're promoting the cloth bags . You know , the reus , reusable cloth bags .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well , we can get a nickel apiece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused .
[B] Oh , that 's great .
-----
[A] They just take it off like they do a coupon .
[A] They can just subtract it from your bill ,
[B] Oh .
[A] and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and they say , y- , as long as it 's clean they do n't want a plastic bag that 's full of goop .
[B] Yes .
[A] Here they do n't want your rotted tomatoes .
[A] But they want any clean and dry plastic bag
[A] so I keep ,
[A] and the thing is , I hardly have room now for all the things that we 're saving it to recycle ,
[A] so right outside the back door , I 've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and wi- , there , right outside the , that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers ,
[A] and now we 've got the bag for the plastic bags .
[B] I understand , uh ,
-----
[B] my husband about once a weekend he 'll go , uh , to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out .
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] And he 'll go pick them up because he just ca n't stand that .
[B] He , he ,
-----
[A] Well , how nice ,
[A] that 's great .
[B] And , uh , it 's so , you know ,
[B] he , we have all our piles of , of recyclables also .
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I remember at Christmas the , the only thing that I 'm ,
[B] when you were talking about the composting , the only thing that our city did that was they di- , uh , provided a place for us to take our Christmas trees .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Uh , to for them to mulch .
[A] Yeah .
[B] For , for city use .
[A] Well , that 's ,
[A] they just put all our Christmas trees in the regular , uh , compost ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] pickup
[A] so they did say that you had to put it out within , I think it was , uh , three weeks after ,
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Christmas .
[B] Right .
[A] And , uh , otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse .
[A] It would have to be cut into four-foot lengths .
[A] So , you know , if we have branches or something ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] they have to be cut in four-foot lengths ,
[A] but otherwise , uh , they have to be in one of their paper bags .
[B] Well , that sounds like you all really have a , a great system worked out there .
-----
[A] And they even picked up our , uh , Styrofoam pl- , packing materials .
[A] They brought , uh , the week after Christmas they left a plastic bag on everybody 's front doorknob with a little note on it saying , we 're trying something new next week only ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] if you have any , uh , of those little , uh , Styrofoam peanuts that ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] any of your Christmas presents were packed in , put them in this bag and leave it out with your recycling
[A] and we 'll , uh , take all of those back and try to recycle them .
[B] Right .
[B] Well , see that 's one ,
-----
[A] But I ,
[A] that 's not going to be a regular feature .
[A] That was just a one time thing right after Christmas .
[B] Well , the ,
[B] but , uh , something nee , does need to be done about the Styrofoam that , uh ,
-----
[A] Well , those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills .
[B] Oh , yeah ,
[B] I mean , they do n't , uh , uh ,
[A] They do n't mash .
-----
[B] No .
[A] They do n't compress at all .
[A] And they stay forever .
[B] Right .
[B] And I 've seen where some places have taken a plastic and , uh , they 're recycling them into other plastics .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And the Styrofoam also into insulation and things like that
[B] and I think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I do too .
[A] The difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile .
-----
[A] It , they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff .
[B] Right .
[A] Uh , because otherwise , uh , you know , they 're not going to go house-to-house collecting it ,
[A] and you 're not going to bother if you have one bag full ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] to drive all the way to some recycling center to turn in just your little plastic peanuts .
[B] Right .
[B] Oh , I was thinking about , you know , like the , uh , the Styrofoam used at , uh , the fast-food restaurants ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] that if everybody , uh ,
-----
[B] and so ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] I know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of Styrofoam
[B] but , uh ,
[A] Now we quit that about two years ago , no , three years ago when we got china mugs for everybody .
[B] Huh .
[A] So , and the only difficulty with that is that we 're in the middle of a five-year drought
-----
[A] and so i- , it 's a real difficult choice whether we want Styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or , uh , china cups to use up our water .
[A] But at the moment we 're using the china cups ,
[A] and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year ,
[A] and then , uh , you 're supposed to keep it recycled every day .
[B] Well , that 's good .
[B] That 's a ,
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] they should last awhile .
[A] Well , let us hope that everybody 's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get , uh , better reuse of things
[A] because ,
[B] I believe we are .
[B] I h- , I have to believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening .
-----
[A] Yep .
[B] And so it will , it will be good ,
[A] It sure will .
[B] in the long run .
[B] Well , I enjoyed it .
-----
[A] Well , good to talk ,
