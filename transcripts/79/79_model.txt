[B] Well I have n't had too much of a chance to watch T V lately .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] So probably everything I going to say is kind of dated .
[A] Well , I can understand that .
[A] It 's that time of the year .
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] We just , my wife and I just recently moved into our house .
[A] So we 're --
[B] Oh .
[A] -- spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things . But .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Um , like to keep up to date too .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I guess , in the ,
[A] since I got out of college , which was about five years ago , my T V viewing started to tend more towards , uh , documentary , news programs , things like that .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Something that 's going to keep mu up to date .
[A] I 've kind of , kind of gotten away from , uh , being a series watcher , having to keep up to date with , uh ,
[B] Oh , yeah .
-----
[B] I think when you 're in college you kind of , you have more of a regular schedule --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- in terms of , you can watch every week .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that makes a big difference .
[B] So , yeah ,
-----
[B] I , I used to ,
[B] when my kids were real little and I was home , I watched ,
[B] where I was home where I watched things on a more regular basis .
[B] But right now , the last things I watched regularly was THIRTY SOMETHING when it first came out .
[A] Okay .
[B] Did you all ever watch that ?
[A] I , yeah , I started , too , and , uh --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- kind of , kind of worked away from that .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I , I have a hard time sticking with something --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- like , like on T V , because , it , like , it gets real aggravating if you miss it , for a week or two .
[A] You feel kind of left out .
[B] Right ,
[B] right .
[A] But , um , right .
-----
[B] I know ,
[B] but I tell you what , um ,
[B] we 're really strict with our kids about television ,
[B] and one night , couple weeks ago , it was just happened that we were exhausted
[B] and they wanted to watch ,
[B] and we said okay , well we 'll sit down
[B] and we 'll , you know , look at what you want to see .
[B] Let 's just turn it on and see what 's on .
[B] We could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it .
[A] I believe that .
[B] So , you know , it was prime time ,
[B] it was , what , seven thirty , eight o'clock on a week night --
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] -- and we have cable ,
[B] and there was n't anything on any channel ,
[B] and the stuff that was on the prime , the networks , you know , A B C , N B C , C B S , was ,
[B] it was just , um , dribble --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- you know , I mean , it was n't even funny --
[A] That 's right .
[B] -- it was n't creative ,
-----
[B] it , it was the worst I 've seen .
[B] I mean , I have not watched prime time , week night T V , I guess in a real long time --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- because I was shocked .
[A] I know exactly how you feel .
-----
[B] You know what I 'm saying .
[A] That 's right .
[A] I , uh , when I first moved down here , moved into the apartment and got cable , and I guess I sort of , kind of became numb .
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the T V , you know .
[A] And then all of a sudden , I started paying , paying attention to network T V again , once in a while .
[B] Right .
[A] Right now we do n't have cable .
[B] Right .
[A] And it 's surprising how much it 's changed --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- the whole moral situation , everything , is just gone one whole complete direction different .
[A] And we do n't have any kids yet ,
[A] but I feel the same way .
[A] It 's really tough to find something that 's --
[B] Right .
[A] -- going to be good and interesting for the kids . Even , even cartoons , um --
[B] Oh .
[A] -- you know , you watch some of the cartoons ,
[A] and kids --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- are n't , are n't even going to understand half the humor that 's in there .
[A] It 's ,
[A] none of it 's probably damaging , lot of times .
[B] Right ,
[B] it 's just , it 's just , uh , like a necessary evil .
-----
[B] I mean , when we , when our children were younger , when they were like four years old , three years old , five years old , we just had Sesame Street
[B] and that was about it , you know .
[A] Right ,
[A] right .
[B] But now , in order to seem , you know , humane and normal , we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff .
[A] Oh , yeah ,
-----
[A] yeah .
[B] But it 's , just one of those things , you know ,
[B] you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something , because those drive you crazy , if you 're , if you 're in the room .
[B] So ,
[A] That 's right .
[B] But it 's such a shame , because it could be so good .
[B] I do n't understand why , first of all , the public puts up with it .
-----
[A] Well , that 's true .
[B] Second of all , why the networks think that , you know , we enjoy that kind of stuff .
[B] It 's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that .
[B] That ca n't be the problem .
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] It must be the marketing pressures ,
[B] and , you know , their demographic studies that they do that show , you know , that everybody 's I Q has dropped dramatically or something .
[A] I 'm glad you said it
[A] and I did n't have to .
[A] But that , that , that 's the ,
[A] I feel the exact same way .
[A] I sit , I sit and watch some shows ,
[A] and I 'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show .
[B] I know .
-----
[A] You know , why do you do this to yourself ?
[B] Why do you do this ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] I know ,
[B] I 'm trying to think if there 's anything I do ,
[B] you , like , uh , I like stuff that 's on Great Performances ,
-----
[B] and , I , we used to watch mystery quite a bit --
[A] Okay .
[B] -- and things like that .
[B] Stuff I guess that mostly public , on public T V .
[A] Right .
[B] As a matter of fact , you know when I was a kid , excuse me , my parents used to have ,
[B] we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular T V that we watched , we had to watch an hour of public T V .
[A] Now there 's an idea .
[B] That was just the rule .
-----
[B] And if they saw us watching the , something ,
[B] they 'd say , all right , what did you see on WHAT 'S NEW ,
[B] or there was some other ,
[B] the children 's program I think at the time was called WHAT 'S NEW .
[A] Okay ,
[A] yeah .
[B] So we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[A] That 's pretty good .
[B] Do you , do you watch sports on T V ?
-----
[B] Are you a sports fan ?
[A] I ca n't handle it very long .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I , I mean , I 'm , I 'm a sports fan ,
[A] but it 's , well , it 's kind of , it 's kind of like reading magazines any more .
[A] If half of the time was n't spent watching commercials , it probably would n't be so bad .
[B] Right ,
[B] yeah .
[A] But , uh , it , it 's ,
-----
[A] you 're missing an awful lot .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I 'd rather , personally rather watch , see a game on T V than fight the crowds at the stadium .
[A] but uh ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's true ,
-----
[B] the traffic .
[A] But , uh , no ,
[B] Uh .
[A] I do n't sit down ,
[A] I 'll sit down for the big games , the Super Bowl , and the championship --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- you know , things like that .
[A] But I do n't follow any team .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I check the scores the next morning ,
[A] and I know how everybody 's doing ,
[A] and that suffices me .
[A] But ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] I like , I like good comedy , good humor once in a while .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I , I enjoy that ,
[B] but what do you , where do you --
[B] -- do you get that come- .
[B] You do n't have cable now ,
[B] I was going to say they have a comedy channel now .
[B] But again you 're in a situation where you 're watching mostly , uh , commercials ,
-----
[B] and then --
[B] -- you 're , you know , trying to pass the time to wait until the next comedian comes up .
[B] You know what I did .
[B] There was a time there where I could tape things
[B] and then I 'd fast forward through the --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- commercials .
[B] Saved a lot of time that way .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it works ,
-----
[A] you bet ,
[A] yeah .
[B] But , that takes too much planning .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] no ,
[A] I do n't know ,
[A] if there 's any , any series that I pay attention to , I try to watch CHEERS once in a while .
-----
[B] Now that , yeah , is that still real good .
[B] It used to be real good .
[B] But .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it is .
-----
[B] Is it .
[A] In fact , it 's , I think it 's on tonight .
[B] Oh .
[A] I just got in from outside ,
[A] so I --
[B] Oh , okay .
-----
[A] -- so I 'm kind of out of it .
[A] Things like that ,
[A] and I consider that fairly intelligent humor .
[B] Yeah .
[A] You know .
[B] Yeah .
[A] You can tell ,
[A] they pick up the words every once in a while .
[B] Right ,
[B] right .
[B] Is n't it such a long running program .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] they do have a good , they do have good writers for that .
[B] Oh , that makes me think ,
[B] do you watch SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE at all ?
[A] I try to .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] we try to stay up , too .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] It 's getting harder and harder .
[B] Ten years ago was n't so hard to stay up .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] you know , it was , it was just automatic , too ,
[A] no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it .
-----
[A] I think it 's come around again .
[A] It 's gone through cycles .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it was ,
[B] we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there ,
-----
[B] but we started watching again .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But it 's real different show than it was when it started .
[A] Yeah .
[B] It 's funny now ,
[B] and it 's better ,
[B] but it 's real different --
[A] That 's right .
-----
[B] -- than what it used to be .
[A] That 's right .
[B] But you ca n't be so , ca n't be outrageous .
[A] Right .
[B] You know , if you keep that same format .
[B] There 's only so long that you can be outrageous .
[B] So ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's for sure , that is for sure .
-----
[A] Well , I guess there are a few things around still
[A] but ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] but you have to hunt hard for them .
[A] Sounds like you pretty much agree .
-----
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I guess so .
[A] Well .
[B] Well .
[A] Been , uh , good talking to you .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] good talking to you .
[A] Okay .
[B] Take care .
[A] You too .
-----
[A] Bye .
[B] Bye .
