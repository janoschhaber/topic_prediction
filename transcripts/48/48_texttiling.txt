[A] All right .
[A] Well , on this subject , I really had n't had to deal with putting someone in there yet ,
[A] but my mother 's always been administrator of a nursing home --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- so I 've always been involved , you know , in one .
[B] How do you feel about them , I mean , since you 've --
[A] Well , I 've
[B] -- kind of been close to that .
[A] Well , I can kind of see both sides , you know ,
[A] I really can .
[A] Uh , nursing homes to me ,
[A] I would personally be the last resort --
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] -- you know , I rea- , you know if I had to put someone in there .
[B] Well , I 've had a touch of experience .
[B] My , um , dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother could n't --
[A] Yeah ,
[A] if it 's a have to thing ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] I ,
[A] yeah .
[B] -- take care of him
[B] and , uh , she put him in ,
[B] but he was n't there very long before he died --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- but , um , I guess , um , the one time that I saw him there , you know , as far as the surroundings , that seemed okay .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But , um , we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of , you know --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- keep him real out of it all the time --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and that 's always kind of bothered me .
[A] Yeah .
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- that 's like everything else , though .
[B] I have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home ,
[B] but I 've never actually been there --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and I know that she 's the kind of person who would n't allow , you know , a lot of the --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- horror things to take place that you hear about .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] but ,
[B] But still --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- I 'm sure there are , you know , aspects to it --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- that are n't really desirable .
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] I know ,
[A] I 've always ,
[A] well , my sister 's involved in one also ,
[A] and I really think they really do a wonderful job .
[A] But still there 's those little things that happens , you know --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- there really is , which
[A] I think , it 's a wonderful place , you know , if it comes to that , you know , if you just ca n't take care of them any more .
[B] Well , sometimes you do n't have any other alternative --
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] that 's it .
[B] -- family and friends are usually , well --
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] -- family 's tied up with --
[A] Other things .
[B] -- their own lives and things , and usually working
[B] and --
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] yeah --
[B] -- it 's hard to ,
[A] -- but I think when the time comes , I , I hope to have the time to really look around , you know --
[B] Yes .
[A] -- and pick one that I really think my mother would be happy at .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] I think that 's important , too ,
[B] in fact --
[A] I do too .
-----
[B] -- there 's a ,
[A] Outside 's awful deceiving sometimes --
[B] Yes .
[A] -- you know .
[B] There 's one close to where my mother is ,
[B] but in order to get in , you have to be able to , um , walk in on your own ,
[B] in other words , you ca n't be in , you know , too bad a shape --
[A] Yeah .
-----
[B] -- to start out with .
[A] Yeah .
[B] But then if you deteriorate , um , they have a separate section for those who need care --
[A] Ca- ,
[A] yeah .
[B] -- you know , all the time .
[A] Yeah .
[B] But it 's always , well ,
[B] and they have a long waiting list , too .
[B] So there 's always this feeling of , well , golly gee , you know , you 've got to be able to walk in the door ,
[B] so you ca n't wait until you 're too bad off --
[A] Off ,
-----
[A] yeah .
[B] -- but then , you do n't want to go do that when you do n't have to --
[A] To ,
[A] no .
[B] -- because like , uh , you have to give up your automobile or whatever .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] and everything you worked so hard for all your life --
[B] Yeah --
-----
[A] -- yeah .
[B] -- and if you 're still capable of driving and doing those things , then you feel like , well , gee , I 'm , you know , I 'm isolating myself --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- here for no reason at the moment .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] So it 's kind of a , that 's a hard one ,
[B] but it is a very nice nursing home .
[A] Now there is some really nice ones .
[A] There 's also , you know , some private ones , you know --
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] -- but of course , I would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that , you know ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's the problem --
[A] that 's way out of my reach .
[B] -- the expense of it all is ,
[B] and , uh , what I , another thing I hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money , and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately .
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] But those who do n't have money can go in and get the same care .
[A] Uh-huh --
[B] You know .
-----
[A] -- the very same ,
[A] yeah .
[B] So I do n't like that aspect .
[A] No ,
[A] but I , there 's , I think there 's ways around it , though , that , you know ,
[A] like , they could put it in one of their children 's names or something --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- you know .
[A] But still , a lot of them does n't feel comfortable doing that .
[A] You know , it 's their money .
[B] That 's right .
-----
[A] You know , that 's how I feel about it , anyway .
[B] Well , yeah ,
[B] I 've talked to my mother about that several times lately ,
[B] and I , I said , I want you to have control of your own business .
[A] Yes .
[B] But , you know , what if .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] my mother 's seventy now ,
[A] so naturally she 's retired ,
[A] but she 's still on her own , I mean .
[B] Yeah ,
-----
[B] yeah ,
[B] my mother 's , uh , seventy-five and still has her own home and everything .
[A] I think that 's wonderful ,
[A] I really do ,
[A] just as long as they can ,
[A] and then on the other hand , I 've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- you know .
[B] That 's true .
[B] They have a lot of people around to do things with .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] they 're not lonely .
[B] Some of those places have wonderful activities and things , you know , lots of stuff going on .
[A] Oh , yes ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] And they 'll take them places --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- so . I do n't know ,
[B] it 's not all bad --
[A] No .
[B] -- but I guess once you get ill , then , you know , you really have some problems if you ca n't get around --
[A] Around ,
[A] yeah .
[B] -- and do things .
[A] But I really do n't know what the other solution would be --
[B] No .
[A] -- you know ,
[A] I really do n't .
[A] But no ,
[A] when the time comes I 'm really , hopefully we 'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- really do ,
[A] because I have been raised in one , you know ,
[A] so there 's lot of things I know to look for .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And I do n't think they 'd want to go where they used to work , either --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- you know .
[A] I really do n't .
[B] That might be kind of tough , huh .
[A] It really would ,
[A] yes ,
[A] yes ,
[A] and like I said , my sister 's still in it ,
[A] and I really do n't think my mother 'd want to be there , either .
[A] Oh .
[A] Well , it 's been nice talking to you .
[B] Well , you too .
[A] And I guess we 'd better get back to work , huh .
[B] Okay .
[A] All right .
[A] Bye-bye .
[B] Bye .
