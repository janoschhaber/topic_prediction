[A] Okay ,
[A] let 's see .
[A] I think , uh ,
[A] I guess , if I call I 'm supposed to start .
[A] I think , uh , that 's the way everybody has done it so far .
[B] Okay .
[A] But , anyway I think that , um , we are paying a lot in taxes ,
[A] but I think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms , and we have a lot of things that the governments do with our money .
[A] Um , we 're probably one of the , the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have .
[A] The , you know ,
[A] as far as the quality of the streets , the school systems , um , the hospital stuff that the government gives money to . Um , the , you know , all the things that the government does like that . I , uh , I think they need to manage it a little bit better ,
[A] but I do n't think , uh , anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks , because they 've been messing it up for many years , now .
[A] So ,
[B] I have to agree that .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And you 're right .
[B] We , I mean , we , you know , we do have a good government .
[B] We do have a lot of things that , you know , that , you know , the taxes are there to support ,
[B] but I do think they 're mismanaged
[B] and I think that sometimes it 's too easy of a , I do n't know , to easy of an answer .
[B] It seems to say , I 'll tax them if you ca n't get enough money , instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or , or , you know , get all of the waste out of the spending .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] Uh , I do n't know what y'all are paying in Dallas ,
[B] but , you know , it seems like we pay the state ,
[B] you know there 's a ,
[B] the taxes set by , you know , the state and the city can add theirs ,
[B] and the county adds theirs ,
[B] and , you know , we 're paying almost eight percent sales tax , right now . Which seems to me nuts .
[B] I came from California
[B] and , you know , when I left there , we paid six cents on the dollar ,
[B] and that was like one of the highest in the nation .
[A] Right .
[A] I think it 's seven here .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Seven point something .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Ourselves is seven point seven five .
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] Whole state .
[A] Yeah .
[B] It drives me crazy .
[B] I 'm thinking , you know , everybody is sitting here screaming about , we do n't want a state income tax ,
[B] but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up
[B] and they do n't do anything about it .
[A] Right .
[B] You know .
[A] Where are you at ?
[A] What state ?
[B] I 'm in Lubbock , Texas .
[A] Oh , really .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[A] There 's ,
[A] we 're still , we 're still one of few that do n't have the , uh , state tax MUMBLEx .
[B] That 's true .
[B] And I did pay state tax in California ,
[B] but my goodness ,
[B] that , that ,
[B] the , what did you call it , the sales tax , is just getting outrageous to pay .
[A] Yeah .
[A] That 's true .
[B] You do n't sound like you 're from Dallas .
[B] Where do you , do you come from originally
[B] Texas ?
[A] Yeah .
[A] I do .
[A] I 've lived in , in the Dallas area here since I was like four .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] So . Uh , it 's , I do n't know , an urban area , I guess
[A] whatever .
[A] I do n't know .
[B] You just , you just managed to escape the real Texan accent ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] I thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there .
[A] No .
[A] No .
[A] I 've just lived here ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] But , I do n't know ,
[A] I do ,
[A] I can think of all the biblical things about it , too .
[A] Where , what did they say to , uh ,
[A] I ca n't think of the scripture .
[A] Render unto Caesar 's what is Caesar 's .
[B] That 's right .
[A] So , you know , even , even in the story where they had to pay the taxes , the disciples ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] and , uh , Jesus said the money in the fish 's mouth or in the fisher , inside the fish .
[A] And , uh , I thought of those two things when I was , I was holding for a long time .
[B] Oh , were you really ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] trying to find someone at home ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] Well , you know , um , back then what they tried to do , you know ,
[B] the MUMBLEx would always try to stump Jesus , try to give him something that would contradict himself ,
[A] Right .
[B] And so that 's what they were trying to do with the tax situation .
[B] And , of course , that 's when he said well you render unto Caesar 's what is Caesar 's ,
[B] you render unto God what is God 's .
[A] Right .
[B] And , uh , you know , of course , there ,
[B] I do n't think they really cared about the answer ,
[A] Right .
[B] they just wanted to try and catch him in something .
[A] Yeah .
[B] But , but I believe in paying taxes
[B] and , I mean , yeah ,
[B] like everybody else , I try to take as many deductions as I can ,
[A] Oh , sure .
[B] MUMBLEx you know , I do n't want to pay more than I have to ,
[A] Sure .
[B] And I get outraged when I feel like they go up for useless reasons ,
[B] but I believe that they 're necessary .
[A] Right .
[B] So , I really do ,
[A] Yeah
[A] are ,
[B] Do you , do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work
[B] or ,
[A] No ,
[A] not really .
[A] I 've , I spends a lot of time with our income tax , though . This , especially , this year and last year .
[A] Um , I have been married for just a few years ,
[A] so I 've had to really switch around from the E Z form to the , uh ,
[B] Schedule A .
[A] Right .
[B] Well , yeah .
[A] All the deductions and all that .
[B] Did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act , it seemed like it made everything harder ?
[A] Yeah .
[A] It really did .
[A] I , I saw , that , too .
[B] I did n't notice anything simplified about it , except that they took away the deductions ,
[A] Right .
[B] the interest and ,
[A] Right .
[B] other things .
[A] We 're looking at buying a house ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] And that was one of the main pluses that we have about buying a house .
[B] And it will help tremendously .
[A] Yeah .
[B] We bought ours five years ago
[B] and it 's
[B] the one thing ,
[B] it seems like you make those payments every month
[B] and at the end of the year you 've paid all interest and no principles .
[A] Right .
[B] So that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back .
[A] Yeah .
[A] There 's a thing I just ,
[A] I 've been trying to learn as much as I can about it ,
[A] if you pay ,
[A] I know I get paid twice a month , every two weeks ,
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] that 's once a month .
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] Well , I get twenty six paychecks ,
[B] That 's right .
[A] which would come out to be in thirteen months .
[A] So if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks ,
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] Instead of once a month , you 'll come out paying a , uh , one month extra every year .
[B] That 's right .
[A] And it will , if have you a thirty year note , it will take like seven or plus years off of your note .
[B] That 's right .
[B] My parents , uh , bought a home in San Diego about four or five years ago ,
[B] And they did that .
[B] They thought their payment was automatically taken out like every other Wednesday ,
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] And that 's exactly right .
[B] Everyone ,
[B] though the note is thirty years , she said it 's going be paid off in twenty or twenty one years ,
[A] Right .
[B] or something like that .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Just because of exactly what you said ,
[A] Right .
[B] You 're making one more month 's payment every year .
[A] And that 's going on the principle ,
[A] it does n't pay any interest ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] or ,
[A] usually it does n't .
[B] That 's a good way to do it .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And when we bought this house , we looked at doing a fifteen year note , because it added more to the payment ,
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] but not significant amounts , you know ,
[B] it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner .
[A] Right .
[A] That 's what we 're looking at , fifteen or maybe twenty .
[B] Yeah .
[A] We 're not going to go longer than twenty .
[B] Yeah .
[A] But , we 're taking our time .
[A] We 're going to try to make our decision by July .
[B] Well , that 's good , though .
[A] Well , we just started two or three weeks ago .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And we 're not going to just kill ourselves
[A] just two or three houses a week at the most .
[B] Well , that 's good , though .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Is it kind of a buyer 's market down there ?
[A] Absolutely .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Well , that 's good .
[A] Credit union has nine percent interest .
[B] That 's pretty excellent .
[A] Yeah .
[A] So that 's ,
[A] I do n't know ,
[A] we could n't think of a better time to buy than now .
[B] That 's good .
[A] But , anyway . Well , um , I ca n't think of a whole lot more to say .
[B] Well , I ca n't either .
[B] I appreciate the call , though .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Me , too .
[B] I enjoyed talking to you .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] same here .
[A] My wife , uh , she went to , uh , the school out there in Lubbock .
[B] In Lubbock ?
[A] She was there for two or three years before we got married .
[A] I guess , before I even met her .
[B] . Just a second .
[A] Okay .
[B] Go ahead .
[A] But anyway ,
[B] So she was at school out here ?
[A] She went to school there .
[B] Well , what was her name ?
[A] Cathy Walker .
[B] No .
[B] I did n't know any Walkers .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Well , good luck in your house hunting .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Thanks a lot .

[B] I , I did all of their capital and financial planning for about eight years .
[A] Oh , wow .
[B] And then I have been in Human Resources for the last two years
[B] and I work with those same people all those nine years ,
[B] so ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] I feel kind of part of the staff .
[A] Yeah .

[B] You are .
[A] Yeah .
[A] That 's funny that 's where you 're from .

[A] A machine that puts back grind tape on and off the waivers .
[B] Oh .
[B] Okay .
[B] So you work in back grind ?
[A] Yeah .
[A] I 'm , I 'm sort of an acting process engineer .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] Not officially ,
[A] but that 's pretty much what I do .
[B] That 's what you do , uh ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] And do you MUMBLEx ?
[A] Right
[A] and MUMBLEx .
[B] Well good deal .
[B] What did you think of Sam ?
[A] Uh , oh , I like him ,
[A] he 's hard ,
[A] but we needed that .
[B] Well , that 's good .
[A] Yeah
[A] he 's ,
[B] He was very good for Lubbock when he came to , you know ,
[B] it was the same kind of thing ,
[B] he had a lot of good results .
[A] Yeah .
[A] That 's , that 's what he said here .
[B] Good .
[A] He 's gotten us into a linear flow that we 've never been in before .
[B] Well , good .
[A] That 's been a real big plus .
[B] Good .
[A] He 's broadened , our , um , the devices that we 're making , too ,
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] which has made us as lot more stable .
[B] Well , that 's good .
[A] Anyway , well , it was nice to talk to you .
