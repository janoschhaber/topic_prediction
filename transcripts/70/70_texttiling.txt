[A] Hi ,
[A] how are you today ?
[B] I 'm great .
[A] Good .
[A] Well as a matter of fact I 'm , before we started this conversation I was working on my P C at home .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Do you have one ?
[B] No ,
[B] I do n't have one at home .
[B] I work with one on , at work --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- continually , you know ,
[B] but I do not have one of my own at home .
[A] Do you have ,
[B] What do you have , at home ?
[A] We have an , um ,
[A] actually it 's a T I computer ,
[A] but it is the I B M --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- um , clone .
[A] It 's not the T I P C --
[B] Right .
[A] -- from back when .
[B] From the oldies but the goodies .
[A] Right .
-----
[B] It 's probably pretty close to what I have , because I have the same kind of thing at work .
[B] I have a three eighty-six S X which is T I computer ,
[B] but everything in , is in I B M mode .
[B] So .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's what we have . Um .
[B] Do you use it a lot at home ?
[A] Well , I really do .
[A] I , um , am an accountant
[A] and ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] but I work at home .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] So you 're on it a lot .
[A] So I use it for that quite often .
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] We have , you know , used some of it for some personal things .
[A] We keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it .
[A] I ,
[A] since it 's tax season , I 'm doing a lot of taxes ,
[A] so I do a lot of , um , a lot of that work on it as well .
[B] I was amazed when I took our taxes to our tax person
[B] and she works out of her home also .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And the , uh , software that does the taxes is just incredible .
-----
[A] Oh it is .
[B] You know , I mean , she just , you know ,
[B] I expected to go and , you know , drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later .
[B] And , you know , she had it done and out in twenty minutes on her little P C .
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] you can .
[B] It was great .
[A] Yes ,
[A] you can ,
[A] that 's right .
[B] That 's wonderful .
[B] I have often thought that , that having one at home would be neat .
[B] I just do n't know if we would really use it that much . You know .
[A] We really ,
[A] we deci- , we did n't decide to get one until I started working at home .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Then , you know , then , we thought , well we can use it for , you know , some personal things .
[A] We di- ,
[A] for us it really took , you know , a business application --
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] -- to justify the expense of it .
[B] Oh , definitely ,
[B] definitely .
[B] I know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer , oh , I guess , probably three years ago for Christmas ,
[B] and , you know , it 's got some stuff on it .
[B] It 's got a nice little word processing software on it , you know , and some budgeting type things and stuff .
[B] And I do n't think she 's ever touched it --
[A] Really .
[B] -- you know .
[B] It just , it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home .
[B] You know , she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer you know .
[B] So .
[A] Right .
[A] She could just as easily do those things by hand .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] just as quickly .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Now I know my boss has bought the software , um , that he can , that his checkbook is on , on --
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- on a disk ,
[B] and he goes in and prin , and types his checks on the screen and then hits print ,
[B] and they print out on the checks ,
[B] and he 's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places --
[A] Oh my gosh .
-----
[B] -- you know ,
[B] and he just whips , out , you know ,
[B] I saw him yesterday morning over there ,
[B] and , and he paid his monthly bills ,
[B] and he just , you know , wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print
[B] and it printed out like ten checks ,
[B] and he just , you know ,
[B] they 're perforated ,
[B] and he just ripped them off .
[B] They go through just a continuous thing on the printer --
[A] Right .
-----
[B] -- and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes
[B] and there they went .
[B] You know , and he said , you know , I can balance my checkbook in seconds , you know --
[A] Right .
[B] -- because it 's all in the computer , you know .
[B] So .
[A] And you know there 's not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make .
[B] That 's exactly why .
[B] He said , you know , he said , used to be I always sat looking for those , you know .
[B] He said this way there is n't any .
[B] You know , it does it for you .
[B] So . This , you know ,
[B] there are some definitely , some , some advantages to it .
[B] It 's just a matter of , like you say , are the advantages , does it justify the cost , if you 're using it strictly for personal business .
[B] So .
[A] Right .
-----
[A] I , I think in most cases I 'd have to say no .
[A] Not unless somebody really enjoys it .
[B] Right .
[A] Or perhaps is using it for education .
[A] I have a four year old son ,
[A] and we have some education programs that he likes .
[A] A little Sesame Street one --
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[A] -- and we have another one that plays music ,
[A] and he really likes that one .
[B] As he grows up he 'll be even more and more too .
[A] That 's right .
-----
[B] That 'll be great .
[A] And yeah ,
[A] on ,
[A] now I think about it ,
[A] I guess for , for kids like , as they get older ,
[A] especially now --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- when they get to junior high school , high school , and even college .
[A] I mean , my sister went to college , started about three years ago ,
[A] and she had to have a , a computer .
[B] Really .
[A] I mean , it was like a necessity .
[B] Well , yeah ,
[B] I .
[A] She could n't imagine going through college without a computer .
[B] Well I 'm going through right now .
-----
[B] I 'm , you know , going part time in the evenings ,
[B] and , you know , I do ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] everything has to be typed .
[B] I mean , they require it .
[B] You have to type it --
[A] Right .
[B] -- you know ,
[B] and , and so I 'm up here , you know , nights and weekends you know , working on the little p- , on the P C up here , you know , typing stuff .
[B] So I can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home , you know , if you were going to school .
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] any more I do n't even know if they have , if a college kid would have a typewriter .
[B] Well , you ,
[B] I do n't know .
[A] Probably not even ,
[A] no .
[B] No ,
[B] no ,
[B] and they probably used to have it .
[B] I just finished a , a major research paper a couple of weeks ago ,
[B] and I could n't imagine not having that thing on a disk --
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] -- where I could go back in and move stuff around and change it .
[B] I , I do n't know what they used to do before they ,
[A] Well , unfortunately in our family , my husband and I went through college together
[A] and then he went on and got his Master 's degree while I was working .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And I 'm the better typist ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] of us ,
[A] and we just had a regular old typewriter , not even a correcting one back then .
[B] Oh --
[A] It was n't that long ago ,
[A] but --
[B] -- and you had to type all of his papers .
[A] -- I typed his Master 's papers and things on a typewriter .
[B] Oh gosh ,
[A] Oh boy , to have a computer back then .
[B] Oh , cut your time in half at least .
[A] At least .
-----
[B] At least .
[A] I mean ,
[A] and then of course you have some changes to make , and do the whole thing over .
[A] You take out a sentence ,
[A] on a computer you take it out , bleep , print it out , fine .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Take out a sentence on a piece of paper ,
[B] You do the whole thing over .
[A] Right .
[B] That 's right .
-----
[B] You know , I remember when I was working in high school , you know , I was working in an office , right after I got out of high school
[B] I continued working there for probably another year .
[B] And we did everything on a typewriter --
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] -- everything .
[B] But it 's amazing , you know ,
[B] then , when , where , you know , someone would have you type a letter , they did it right , they did it right .
[B] I mean , they were ,
[A] The first time .
-----
[B] Yeah ,
[B] they sit there
[B] and they go , is this really what I want to say ,
[B] and you typed it
[B] and that was it ,
[B] and now , you know people just send it back over and over and over and over .
[A] That 's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it 's brought about , because people do feel like , Oh well , we can just change it .
[B] Well , we 'll try this out and see what it looks like .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] use it as a , just a ,
[B] Yeah ,
-----
[B] instead of knowing what they want to say --
[A] Right .
[B] -- before they eve- , they just , you know , play with it , and , which in a way is nice to be able to do ,
[B] but , you know , it , it gets a little out of hand sometimes .
[B] I 've seen it get out of hand up here , you know --
[A] Oh yeah .
-----
[B] -- where we 've got a secretary that sits over here that 's keeping metrics right now , and keeping up , you know , of all the letters I type , how many cha- , how many of them do I make changes on . And on each letter , what types of changes .
[B] Are they typos ?
[B] Are they because I could n't read it
[B] or people just change a , like , one word because they think it sounds better , or whatever .
[B] And , you know , she 's also keeping a percentage , you know , what percentage of letters am I retyping for whatever reason .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And there 's like one week , she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed --
[A] I believe it .
[B] -- you know ,
[B] and it 's like , you know , it 's ridiculous
[B] and that was , that was the high week ,
[B] but it 's running about seventy --
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] -- which is still ridiculous to have to make changes to seventy percent of everything that she types .
[A] Well , it 's good that she does that , I mean , bring it to people 's attention .
[B] Well , that 's exactly right .
[B] You know , she keeps , you know keeps several weeks ' worth of data and then in addition is keeping copies of all the changes to show , you know , look , this did n't really need to be changed .
[B] You know , this is ridiculous and you know , changing , add this time to now .
[B] You know , I mean , that 's the kind of things , you know , that she 's keeping and showing , that , this was a big waste of time , it was a waste of paper , it was a waste , you know --
-----
[A] Right ,
[B] -- to change something like that .
[B] So . Anyway , maybe , you know , maybe it 'll , it 'll help in some way ,
[B] but I do n't know .
[B] There , there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative .
[A] Oh I have to ,
[B] Without a doubt .
[B] Without a doubt .
[B] Well , I would like to get one at home some day .
[B] We 've got a two year old son ,
[B] and so , you know , some day I would like to get , even just like the video tell , or something like that , you know , just to , to be able to pull in sources from outside would be wonderful .
[B] You know so ,
[A] Especially when they 're in school , I think they would get a lot out of it .
[B] Oh , I do too ,
[B] I do too .
[B] The on line encyclopedia just sounds wonderful ,
[B] you know , that sounds like such a great idea ,
[B] you know , it 'd be kind of fun to be able to play with it .
[B] So . I know , my father had a P C ,
[B] and when we were in high school it was always fun .
[B] We could , um , link in ,
[B] and I do n't even remember now what it was called .
[B] But you could link in and talk to other peo- , talk to people all over the country , you know .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , like , you have your own little code name , you know ,
[B] and you 'd type in du du du , Hi how are you , du du du ,
[B] and they 'd type back and everybody ,
[B] and you 'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time ,
[B] and everything everybody said prints out on your screen as they 're typing it ,
[B] and it was just great fun , you know ,
[B] It was very expensive , because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance , you know .
[B] It was like a --
[A] Ooh .
[B] -- long distance phone call .
[B] So , we were each limited to like twenty minutes a day , you know ,
[B] so .
[A] Ooh ,
[A] that still could add up .
[B] Oh it added up big .
[B] Well , you know , we , my parents were divorced
[B] and so the time we were like visiting our father in the summer time , you know ,
[B] so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I 'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations , you know .
[B] But when you 're doing the guilty father complex , you know , because he 's not there to watch us grow ,
[B] you can kind of get all kinds of stuff .
[B] That 's sad .
[B] Well , it was nice to talk to you .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] you too .
[B] Have a ,
[A] Have a nice day .
[B] You too .
[A] Bye-bye .
[B] Bye .
