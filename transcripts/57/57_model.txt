[A] All right .
-----
[B] Well , like I told you before , MUMBLEx .
[B] And you 're talking about credit cards .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] We put ours up .
[B] I mean I had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up .
[A] Um , I wish I had .
[B] Well , you should try it .
-----
[A] Well , I ,
[A] it was done for me after a while .
[A] I had a , uh , I had a business going .
[A] And this was back in the eighties .
[A] I do n't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that .
[A] But , uh , I had a coin shop ,
[A] and everything was going great while gold and silver was up ,
[A] and it started falling .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So I started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards ,
[A] and things got worse and worse ,
[A] and finally , boom .
[B] You lost your business ?
-----
[A] Yep .
[B] Oh , gol .
[B] What a nightmare .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it was .
[A] I ended up going into bank- , you know ,
[A] it was one of those things uh ,
[A] Oh , it 'll get better next week , you know .
[A] Things will pick up .
[A] And , so , there I was in old bankruptcy court .
[B] Well , you were n't charging gold and silver were you ?
-----
[B] You ca n't do that , can you ?
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] Oh , you can ?
-----
[A] Oh , yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[A] I was buying from other dealers ,
[A] and , uh , you know , they take payment any way they can get it .
[B] Oh , that 's a nightmare .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Course on , on stuff that I was , on merchandise that I was buying on cards , it was , I was getting the money back ,
[A] because I was selling it .
-----
[A] I was n't buying , you know , just to hold onto it .
[A] Uh , but it was things like , you know , rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] So .
[B] Well , I remember before I got married ,
[B] you know when you graduate from college they 'll send you all those --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- credit card applications --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- you know ,
[B] of course you fill them all out because you 're honored .
[A] Sure .
[B] And , uh , I had stuff for like Sanger Harris ,
[B] and , you know , it got up like to couple of hundred dollars ,
[B] and I thought , Well that 's okay , cause all they wanted was ten dollars a month .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Right .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I was n't thinking a thing about it .
[A] That 's the way they suck you in .
-----
[B] Yeah .
[B] I was just stupid ,
[B] and every time they had a sale , there I was .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Because , you know , got , get such good bargains .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And I do n't know .
[A] Well , just today in the mail I got , uh , I got , got my guaranteed acceptance by , uh , American Express .
[B] Oh , yeah ,
[B] we 've been getting those .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I went back to school and got my Master 's ,
[B] and they started sending those things to me again .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] as soon as you 're a graduate student they get your name .
-----
[B] Yeah ,
[B] they did .
[A] And , uh , course , I guess , I guess I 've been purged from their records .
[A] I used to have an American Express .
[A] Uh , back when I had my business I got one .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And they , they goofed up bad on my fir , on my very first bill ,
[A] because I was using the American Express strictly for the travel expenses .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And the bill would come in ,
[A] and I 'd pay it .
[A] And the very first bill , I paid it ,
[A] and then I got this nasty letter from them saying , You 're overdue , pay .
[A] So I said , Well , it just crossed in the mail .
[A] So I did n't do anything about it .
[A] Two weeks later I get another letter , even nastier ,
[A] and said , We 're going to turn this over to our attorneys if you do n't pay .
[A] And I looked at that ,
[A] and I said , Uh-huh .
[A] So by this time my checks had come back from the bank .
[A] So I made a copy of the check that they had cashed --
[B] Um .
[A] -- attached it to their letter , and sent them a nasty letter with the card cut in little bitty pieces , saying Thanks , but no thanks .
[B] Turned out they were n't cheeky .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] they were , I tell you .
[A] They do n't talk about they 're charging that enormous fee every year .
-----
[B] So what is it now ?
[A] It 's up to fifty-five on the gold card .
[A] It 's eighty-five for the Optima .
[A] Or , I 'm sorry no ,
[A] fif- ,
[A] no
[A] fif- ,
[B] What do you mean fifty-five ?
[B] You mean fifty-five dollars ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] for the green card .
-----
[B] But then , what 's the interest ?
[A] Well , now , that 's the card , see .
[B] And interest is like eighteen or something .
[A] Oh , yeah ,
-----
[A] yeah .
[A] It 's , um ,
[A] well , of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in , so there is n't any .
[A] But on the Optima card it 's ,
[A] um , let 's see , right now it 's running at about .
[A] It 's not too bad .
[A] It 's actually , it 's about sixteen and a half percent , which is pretty good , as far as credit cards go .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Well , credit cards .
[A] Well , they 're dangerous .
[B] You know , my parents do n't hardly use them .
-----
[A] Huh-uh .
[A] Mine do n't either ,
[A] mine do n't either .
[A] They , uh ,
[A] my mom has a , uh , has a MasterCard and a Visa card ,
[A] and that 's it .
[B] I 've got all my gas cards , because I do n't want to carry money around .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I 'll do that .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] now I , I do use gas cards .
[B] Now Impact is kind of bad too , though .
[A] Yeah ,
[B] You know . Especially if you get , forget to record those little suckers .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] exactly .
[A] Plastic is just too easy ,
[A] I mean --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- that 's the , that 's the whole problem with it .
-----
[A] Um ,
[B] Well , and you 're tempted if you 've got cash , a little bit of cash , and you do n't have enough for the purchase , right .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Of course , you got to charge it and keep your cash .
[A] Sure ,
[A] naturally .
[A] That 's ,
[A] I got into all kinds of trouble doing that .
-----
[B] What are you saying ?
[B] Oh , my husband says I might buy it ,
[B] but I , I do n't really usually consider that an option .
[B] Maybe that 's how we got in trouble .
[A] Having , having been out of the credit game for some years now , I 've gotten used to either paying in cash or not getting it .
[A] And , uh ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] but it 's hard , is n't it ?
-----
[A] Well , it is ,
[A] but , I , I , I 'm kind of , uh , grateful for the experience because it 's taught me a lot of restraint .
[B] Well , it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] exactly .
[A] I , I , uh , I just went out and got a new V C R yesterday with cash .
[B] With cash ?
[A] And , it , it 's ,
-----
[B] Do you work with T I ?
[B] No .
[A] No ,
[A] I wish I did .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] you could have got a discount , could n't you ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I could use a discount .
[A] I have to wait for things to go on sale .
[B] But there 's always a sale .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] especially on electronic goods --
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- especially now .
[B] What is that thing I saw ,
[B] Circuit , Circuit World or something .
[A] Circuit City .
-----
[B] Circuit City .
[B] Have you been in there ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] they , they 're not , their prices are n't that terrific .
[A] They , they used to be ,
-----
[A] but they 've gotten , they 've got to pay for all that national advertising now .
[B] Oh , it 's national ?
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I think I 've seen two around Dallas .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] they 're , they 're all over the country now .
[B] Well , what else ,
[A] They , they used to be good .
[A] I remember when they first opened up .
[A] They did have good bargains .
[A] I do n't know if you have a place there called , uh ,
[A] or you probably have something similar .
-----
[A] We call it Service Merchandise .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] in Garland .
[A] You got Service Merchandise .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it used to be Service Merchandise was the place to go .
[A] And , uh , Circuit City came along
[A] and that was the place to go to get your T V -s and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that .
[A] And then after the years went by , they just sort of kept creeping up on price ,
[A] and actually Service Merchandise is cheaper than them now .
[A] So .
[B] So .
[A] So much for Circuit City .
[B] So . Okay ,
[B] what else can we talk about ?
-----
[B] Who do you work for ?
[A] I do n't ,
[A] I 'm a graduate student .
-----
[A] I 'm a professional student .
[B] Sounds wonderful .
[A] It is .
-----
[B] We were talking about that just today .
[A] It 's great .
[B] We could be just lifelong students .
-----
[A] It is great .
[A] I love it .
[B] Where are you going to school ?
[A] N C State .
[B] What 's that ?
-----
[A] Uh , North Carolina State .
[B] So you 're on Spring Break ?
[A] Not yet .

[A] What do you mean , where ?
-----
[A] Oh ,

[B] Oh , okay .
[A] Little ,
[A] the burgeoning metropolis of Raleigh .
[A] What a dead place .
[B] Is it ? .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[A] I 've got a nice little business at home ,
[A] and I sit around and tinker with that most of the time .
[B] So what are you getting your degree in ?
[A] Um , uh , human factors .
-----
[B] And what do you do with it ?
[A] Not a thing .
[B] Well , what is it ?
[A] It 's , it 's really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them .
-----
[B] So it 's sociology .
[A] It 's , well , it 's more psychology and engineering .
[A] Uh ,
[A] my , my master 's is in industrial engineering .
-----
[B] So you 're working on your doctorate ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] Oh lord .
[A] P H D in human factors .
-----
[B] Oh , that will , that will sound wonderful , wo n't it ?
[A] Well ,
[B] Get you a little MUMBLEx plaque .
[A] Oh , yeah .
-----
[A] I B M , uh ,
[A] I mean , uh , a lot of people use human factors ,
[A] folks ,
[A] but I B M is what I 'm looking at right now .
[B] Are n't , are n't they laying off several thousand people ?
-----
[A] They might be ,
[A] but not at , not at the human factors level .
[A] They , they 're ,
[B] Well , I heard it on the news today ,
-----
[B] I could swear it was I B M .
[A] No ,
[A] as a matter of fact , the I B M right here , or in Carey , which is a little suburb of Raleigh , just , just hired one more human factors person .
[B] Um .
[A] Doggone it ,
-----
[A] if they 'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been
[B] How much longer do you have ?
[A] I 'm , I 'm , I 'm going into thes- , or going into the , uh , dissertation this summer .
-----
[B] And get that done this summer ?
[A] Uh , I 'm going to start this summer .
[A] I probably wo n't finish it until the end of the year --
[B] Ooh .
[A] -- but , uh , I 'm , I 'm trying to get a , uh , intern position with I B M right now so that I can find an area to do my dissertation in .
[B] Because you ,
[A] It 's hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field .
[B] Why ?
[B] There has been so much work done already ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's ,
-----
[A] that and , and , it 's , it 's limited application in some respects .
[A] Um , conside- , in the area that we 're in here , there 's a lot of places that use human factors people .
[A] Most ,
