[A] All Right .
-----
[A] Ladies , first .
[B] Oh , no .
[B] Well , I do n't find a lot of time to watch T V .
[B] And a lot of time , I find it during the day when , when I 'm rocking my little girl to sleep ,
[B] so I watch a lot of reruns , old shows ,
[B] Like DICK VAN DYKE , all those old crazy shows .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I really enjoy watching ANDY GRIFFITH .
[A] Well , some- ,
-----
[A] so you 're a homemaker ?
[B] Yeah .
[A] I guess , that 's , the right term nowadays .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I guess so .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I am .
[B] I stay home with two kids .
[A] Yeah .
[A] My wife ,
-----
[A] we have a new one in the house
[A] and she stays home , too , also .
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] Um , I guess , I have a wide variety .
[A] I like watching the T V for things that are interesting ,
[A] not so much the bor- , things that are n't ,
[A] for example , like the COSBY SHOW to me is just kind of like a waste of my time ,
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] and DIFFERENT STROKES .
[A] But I like SIXTY MINUTES ,
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] PRIME TIME LIVE .
[A] Of course , I have to watch cartoons on Saturday morning , but not the NINJA TURTLES .
[A] I like the old-timey ones ,
[A] TOM AND JERRY .
[B] You sound like my husband .
[A] There you go .
-----
[B] He likes TOM AND JERRY and , uh , BUGS BUNNY AND ALL HIS FRIENDS .
[A] Right .
[B] And all those guys .
[A] JOHNNIE QUEST . MUMBLEx the good ones .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Um , now if I 'm ever home during the , during the day on a vacation day , I have to catch at twelve o'clock the ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW , because I usually ,
-----
[A] because he 's just , he 's one of my idles .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And then , uh , but I do n't know ,
[A] it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic , you know , magnified and animated ,
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] that you can grab from the old style movies and old style shows a little bit more insight to family groupings .
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] And so , uh , now I do , with the COSBY SHOW ,
[A] I have seen it a couple of times
[A] and , I do ,
[A] I like the show .
[A] I just do n't watch it .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Because of the timing ,
[A] but , uh , some of the crap that 's on T V nowadays ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] it 's about .
[A] I do watch the special shows that they come out with , the NOVA stuff . And , and ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] the nature shows .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[A] But , I think there 's enough out there to pick from .
[A] I 'm not ,
[A] we do n't have cable to the point of , of the H B O or any of that stuff .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[A] But , uh ,
[B] Well , I find myself watching just a whole lot of whatever is geared for children . Because ,
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] with two kids
[B] and , you know , I do n't want them watching something that I do n't think they should watch
[B] or ,
[A] Sure .
[B] I used to be really hooked on ALL MY CHILDREN ,
[A] Oh , me .
[B] And I watched that for like , oh , ten or fifteen straight years ,
[A] Oh , no .
[B] and then I had , well , you know , I 'd eat
[B] like at work , we 'd have a T V or whatever .
[B] And then , um , as my kids got older and started , you know , recognizing what was going on , I thought , this is n't really very good .
[B] So I gave it up .
-----
[A] Fifteen years .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Bet they hated that .
[B] I watched , I had watched it since it started .
[B] So ,
[A] Oh , goodness .
[B] Uh , now I , I do n't know who the characters are ,
[B] and , um , I 'll turn it on every once in awhile
[B] and I do n't recognize anybody ,
-----
[B] so I guess that 's a good sign .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Really .
[A] I used to watch , uh ,
[A] I can recall ,
[A] this might age me , date me here , uh ,
[A] I can remember staying home , when I was five and six ,
-----
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] and my mother watching the EDGE OF NIGHT .
[B] Oh , yeah .
[B] Well , see , you 're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the SECRET STORM ,
-----
[A] SECRET STORM .
[B] and the EDGE OF NIGHT .
[A] Well , I think they were back to back ,
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] and black and white .
-----
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] I was just a youngster
[A] and I was like , oh , my gosh .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] we used to ,
[B] my mother watched all that stuff , too .
[B] And AS THE WORLD TURNS . I think AS THE WORLD TURNS may ,
[A] Still be on .
-----
[B] still on or not .
[B] It was not too long ago .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Now they got a lot of other crap involved .
-----
[A] And so ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] You 're right .
[A] I think some of the tones of the , the daily prime time is questionable ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] And that could be , uh ,
[A] I have to agree with you .
[B] Yeah .
[A] You know keep them on the channel eleven , channel twenty one .
[B] Right .
[A] The nature stuff , you know .
[B] Yeah .
[B] We do ,
[B] and it 's real interesting , too , the difference in my kids ,
-----
[B] like um , my oldest loved SESAME STREET ,
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] And those kind of shows .
[B] My younger one does n't .
[B] She 's more into WALT DISNEY kind , you know ,
[B] we watch a lot of movies that we 've got on V C , on tapes ,
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] and stuff .
[B] She 's more into the animated stuff , where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing
[B] so ,
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] But , um , we do a lot of kid watching .
[A] Well , sounds like you got your hands full there ,
[A] and I do appreciate speaking with you .
[B] Sure .
[B] It was fun .
[A] Have you gotten your catalog yet ?
-----
[B] No ,
[B] I do n't think so .
[A] Yeah .
[A] I just spoke with Jim .
[A] I just got my in the mail
[A] and it inspired me to make more phone calls .
-----
[B] Oh , well , see I do n't really .
[B] I 've had a few people call me ,
[B] but , I 've never made one .
[A] Oh , really .
-----
[B] Yeah .
[B] I need to get brave .
[A] Yeah .
