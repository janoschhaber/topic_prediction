[A] There we go .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Well , uh , I think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than I would expect this time of year .
[A] I think that 's true .
[A] The , uh , the Bermuda grass is greening up in March ,
[A] and sometimes does n't really start doing that until the first part of April .
[A] So .
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] So I think we 're a little hea- , ahead of schedule on that .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I was out in my yard yesterday afternoon ,
[B] and I noticed all that grass coming up ,
[B] and I thought , ooh ,
[B] we 've got to start this mowing bit soon .
[A] That 's true .
[A] It 's been a , a fun break ,
[A] but the break is over .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Well , um , oh , I guess another thing I 've noticed , too , here lately is that even though we 've had some pretty warm days , it 's been awfully gray , you know , just ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] now , the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny .
[B] Yeah .
[B] But it seems like every time at work I look out my window it 's gray .
[A] Well , yeah ,
[A] but I 'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend .
[B] Oh , I go for that ,
[B] yeah .
[A] Yeah .
-----
[B] In fact , I 'm a little worried about this one coming up here .
[B] We have a long weekend
[B] and , it sounds like it 's going to be a little bit on the cool side .
[A] Yeah .
[A] I have n't heard whether it 's going to rain or not .
[B] I think there 's an eighty percent chance this evening ,
[B] but it 's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow
[B] and then the rest will be without rain .
[A] Well , that 's good .
-----
[B] But I think the highs are going to be in the sixties , and the lows in the forties .
[B] That 's getting back to a little bit chillier .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year .
[A] I think ,
[A] I have n't seen the wea- , the weather on the news in the evening lately ,
[A] but I think the average high would be , should be about seventy .
[B] Yeah .
-----
[B] I 'm not certain either ,
[B] but you 're probably right .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Well , I like it when it 's sort of a medium temperature , uh , maybe seventy-five to eighty , somewhere in there .
[B] I do n't like it when it 's too cool or too warm .
[B] I 'm much more apt to get things done when it 's at that sort of in between temperature .
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] that 's true .
[A] Um , one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninety-nine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high .
[B] Um .
[A] And what that tells me , is that the summer weather is very predictable , that it does n't vary very much .
[B] Yeah .
[B] You 're probably right .
[A] I mean , any other time of year , that 's not the case , because it could be very warm or very cold .
[B] Yes ,
[B] as a matter of fact , I heard the weather the other day on T V
[B] and I think it was one day this week a year ago --
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] -- they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather . You know --
[A] Right .
[B] -- it was n't just a super bad storm ,
[B] but it was --
[A] Right .
[B] -- it was that sort of thing that we never like to see in the , the late spring time .
[A] Yeah .
[A] One of the weirdest things I saw , I think it was around this time last year was a twenty-six degree lightening storm .
[B] Oh , wow .
-----
[A] I , you know , I was going into the grocery store ,
[A] and a , a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead ,
[A] and it was twenty- six degrees out .
[B] Um .
[A] And I thought , Well gee , I 've , I 've never known it to lightening at that temperature .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that , that is pretty unusual .
[B] And you really take notice of it , too .
[A] That 's right .
[A] It , uh , it probably was a lot warmer up high .
[A] Sometimes they get those inversions , like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing .
[A] The air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees .
[B] Um .
[A] The cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and could n't get away .
[B] Wow .
[B] I do n't , do n't like that super cold stuff .
[A] Nope .
[B] I just do n't move very well when it 's that cold .
[A] Yep ,
[A] I , I 'm really enjoying this now .
[A] Well , this has been interesting .
[B] Yeah , well .
[A] Not too challenging to the brain .
[B] Not , not a real in depth topic , but --
[A] Nope .
[B] -- enjoyed talking to you .
[A] All right , Ellen ,
[A] well you have a good day .
[B] Okay .
[A] Bye .
[B] Bye-bye .
