[B] Okay .
[B] Well ,
[A] First of all , I want to tell you I have two little kids ,
[A] but they 're not in public school yet .
[A] I , I get , I get that experience starting next fall --
[B] Ah .
[A] -- with kindergarten .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[B] So you have n't really , uh , dealt with that in a sense .
[A] No .
[A] But , uh , being one of these late in life mothers , I 've listened to everybody else 's , you know ,
[A] complaints as to wha , what 's the matter with either their kids or the school system .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- I 've been surprised .
[A] Do , are , do you have school age kids ?
[B] Uh , mine are both out of school .
[A] Oh .
[B] And , uh ,
[B] you know , I , I 've , in hindsight , seen some things that I wished that , you know , I had done something about that was , you know , within my power or , uh , you know , wish that in some ways we , as parents , had more control over --
[A] Such as ?
[B] -- what 's happening up there , you know , type thing .
[B] Uh , well , just over the years there were situations that , uh , uh , came up that I did n't think were fair or handled correctly
[B] or the teachers did n't seem to be teaching anything .
[B] Of course , it 's a little hard to tell from the information that you get from your child , you know .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] They , they bring things home
[B] and I was never one to believe everything my kids said ,
[B] you know , about something .
[B] But , uh , still I , I questioned the ability of some of the teachers to , uh , really do a bang-up job ,
[B] and yet others I know are just wonderful .
[A] Well , I heard a , a frightening thing .
[A] Actually , I did n't hear it .
[A] It was told to me or suggested to me , uh , that to work as a teacher in the public school systems in the state of Texas ,
[A] and I think it 's similar in , in many other states , if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage --
[B] Huh .
[A] -- of , uh , people to teach math and sciences .
[A] And somebody said , well , you know , you could go in and , and substitute teach at seventy-five dollars a day
[A] and there 's always going to be , you know , somebody having a need for a math or science teacher .
[A] I thought , Christ , they 're letting me in , --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- to , you know ,
[A] this would be , this would be frightening .
[A] I do n't know anything about it .
[B] That 's pretty interesting because just ,
[B] just because you know a subject matter --
[A] Right .
[B] -- does n't mean you can teach it .
[A] Right .
[A] And even if I knew how to teach the subject matter , I do n't know if I 'd know how to handle that kind of a , a group of kids .
[B] Oh , yeah .
[B] In fact , I think that 's , that 's one of the big problems today is the , the way the kids behave or act and , and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what 's going on in the class and disruptive .
[A] I tell you what I 'm finding frightening
[A] and this comes from , you know , the , the aging hippie near forty mother .
[A] So I went through this period of supposedly , you know , cosmic social enlightenment .
[A] I 'm on , I 'm in the Plano school system and living in Richardson ,
[A] and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And I used to think , well , that 's wonderful .
[A] You know , they can get a real life experience .
[A] What I 'm seeing now , uh , in terms of kindergarten preparedness , just from , in , in , in different preschools --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- it 's like day and night .
[A] And I wonder , how do they handle a child who is obviously very ready and another child who does n't even speak English , let alone know her colors .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And they 're in the same classrooms .
[A] And I guess also you 're going to see the first of the , uh , crack kids starting kindergarten .
[A] My God , I think it would be next year is what I 'd read .
[A] I thought , well , how do you , how do you weed those out ?
[B] Yes .
[B] Some of those certainly have a lot of dis- , difficulties , you know , with , uh , all sorts of things ,
[B] and I would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases .
[A] When I was listening to N P R , the National Public Radio ,
[A] and they 've quoted statistics that I just about , my throat just about fell into my toes .
[A] They said at the bottom of the S A T scores of graduating college seniors are usually those people that go into education .
[B] Oh , wow .
[A] Yes .
[B] That 's encouraging .
[A] Yes .
[A] And I , and I , I got to thinking back when I was teaching college chemistry , the people that took , you know , the lower level courses , I sometimes wondered , you know , are they really even educatable or trainable
[A] and it ,
[A] my God , you know , i- ,
[A] are the rest of us who went for the big bucks , you know , staying out of , you know , where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated to spend some time teaching or something with --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- these kids ?
[A] I do n't know .
[B] Well , that 's , you know , that 's an idea .
[B] Maybe there need to be some radical changes made .
[B] Do some things that are totally different and unheard of .
[A] Well , you know , you , you sit here
[A] and you think about that .
[A] At the same time you think , God , I hope I do n't sound like a stage mother because ,
[A] right now if you ask my friends t- , put twenty mothers in a room and ask them how many have gifted children , you 're going to have twenty hands , you know , up there .
[B] Oh , you 're kidding .
[A] Oh , no .
[A] Nobody has , nobody has a nongifted child .
[A] And I keep thinking , you know , gifted is , is Einstein or , you know , uh , musical prodigies .
[A] It 's , it 's not a kid who 's , you know , precocious .
[B] Yeah .
[A] You know , what has , you know , has , has the educational system been watered down to that anybody who 's above average is now gifted ?
[B] Huh .
[A] I do n't know .
[B] That 's interesting .
[B] I do n't know .
[B] Mine did n't , did not fall into the gifted category .
[A] Oh , do n't say that .
[B] Nope .
[B] And I would never had said so either .
[B] Uh , but , uh , they managed to get through , although not always with flying colors .
[B] Uh , in fact , one of the incidents I was thinking of that my son had . Uh , he was struggling with senior English
[B] and I had a meeting with the , uh , vice principal and the English instructor ,
[B] and , uh , she showed me a paper that he had just handed in .
[B] And she told me what she had requested .
[B] And I read it
[B] and while it had , you know , a few little grammatical problems , it was n't very long and so forth .
[B] I thought it had some nice , well thought out , uh , parts to it .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] She gave him an F on that paper .
[B] And I thought , well now , here you have a student who is trying to pass , who is struggling with your subject
[B] and you give them an F on something that does n't seem that bad to me .
[B] What are you telling that student ?
[B] You 're telling them that , hey , you might as well forget it , you know .
[A] Well , you see , I think that , that harks right back to the elementary and junior high years .
[A] Because I have a stepson now who 's twenty-five
[A] and , uh , I was just absolutely shocked , uh , the first time that I saw his schoolwork .
[A] Uh , I remember being , you know , taught ,
[A] and I think , you know , you have to teach how to write an answer and , you know , how to construct a thought process .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , you know , they can get a , they can grasp the points .
[A] Can they convey the data verbally or in writing .
[A] And that 's what 's , you know , really scary to me .
[A] Uh , I would really , you know ,
[A] there 's such a , a push among young mothers these days to make sure their child is computer literate .
[A] I would really think that they should be stressing more can the kid write a thought and at an early age .
[A] And if they ca n't , I mean if they have missed that training , then somebody , you know , before you 're , you 're start penalizing them with bad grades for not being able to communicate what they 're thinking , teach them these basic skills .
[B] Yeah .
[B] It 's pretty sad to think , uh , about those who , even today , are graduating from school
[B] and they are telling that they do n't know how to read , you know .
[A] Well , my stepson , you know , I , he went into the Navy or Air Force .
[A] I just really get my military ,
[A] I married into a military family ,
[A] and I do n't know ,
[A] I re- , address them all as generals
[A] so I do n't offend anybody .
[A] But , uh , you know , fortunately for him , he was n't dumb
[A] but boy he sure had trouble , you know , putting things on , on paper .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And one of the things that , that they did for him . They tested him
[A] and they said that he 's , you know , great in electronics
[A] but he , you know , he 's , really does need the basic skills .
[A] And they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training .
[A] And at that point , he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors .
[B] Oh .
[A] This is the kid who , who really , you know , barely --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- made it through high school .
[A] And I keep thinking , you know , it 's not , it 's really not too late at any point to do , you know , some- ,
[B] That 's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it .
[A] Yes .
[B] You would have expected them to be the last ones to .
[A] Yes .
[A] And I kind of have always pooh-poohed military educations .
[A] But I think that for this kid , it 's going to be , you know , his lifesaver .
[A] Otherwise , he might have been driving trucks or framing houses , you know , from here to eternity .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So , I do n't know .
[A] You know , it does make me nervous .
[B] Well , I can see why if you 've got little ones just coming along .
[B] There 's a , a whole lot of stuff going on out there .
[A] There is a whole lot of stuff going on out there
[A] and , and part of me says I just would like to , you know , shut my eyes and pretend it does n't , you know , go on . Or send them to private schools .
[A] And then the , you know , the old social conscience says , you know , I 'm not working , I do n't need to work .
[A] Maybe I should volunteer to , you know , teach what I know .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Maybe adult literacy . Maybe , you know , composition writing . Maybe , you know , uh , volunteering , you know , on a tutor line or though the , even through the elementary schools for help with homework
[A] or , the other part of me says , is God , I 've had enough kids .
[A] Do I reall- , .
