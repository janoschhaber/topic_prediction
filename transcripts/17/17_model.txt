[A] Okay .
-----
[B] The topic is to discuss the , uh , sources where I receive news .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , uh , for me that 's mostly newspaper and radio ,
[B] I almost never watch television , as a matter of course
[B] so , I do n't get news from television ,
[B] except during the war ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I watched a lot of C N N because it was so good .
[A] Well , why was C N N the only ,
[A] of course I think , Saddam Hussein only allowed C N N to broadcast it ,
-----
[A] is that not true ?
[B] Um .
[A] It was unusual not to have the different sources , you know , of news coverage .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Um , I do n't know .
-----
[B] I guess , uh , I do n't even know why I watched C N N .
[B] I guess , I just wanted more news .
[B] It 's one of the few times I wanted more news than .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well , I know even if you watched A B C , N B C or the other ,
[A] I mean , what 's the other one , uh , C B S .
[B] C B S .
[A] They all were , were tapped into C N N .
[B] Were they ?
[A] Uh-uh .
[B] Yeah .
[A] That 's the only thing they broadcast
[A] and like you I listened to radio on my job at work .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And all this week they have been having this , uh , a discussion about that is why , uh , why C N N was
[A] well , I listen to a Christian radio station .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And they were saying that C N N is definitely a world , uh , news service
[A] and , uh , they ,
[A] it was ,
-----
[A] you ca n't really be sure of the quality of what you 've got , you know .
[B] Huh .
[A] Uh , we had some , uh , some people from our church went to Israel , uh , just for a , uh , tour sort of thing .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And I was watching on TV
[A] they , they broadcast this terrible riot
[A] supposedly that was going on in Jerusalem ,
[B] Right .
[A] and so it really made me question as to what , how do we know , you know , uh , if the news we 're getting is any good .
[A] So ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I guess , the news just focuses on major events that probably ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] do n't affect ninety-nine percent of the people who are right there when the news is being made .
[A] Right ,
[A] right .
[B] But , uh , I , I 'm from California
[B] and I can remember being in , uh , in these earthquakes
[B] and , I mean they were ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] they were very minor kinds of things from my point of view , and it seemed , you know , from anyone else 's point of view ,
-----
[B] but they get all blown up in the news . Um ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Well I , I find it depressing to watch our ,
[A] specially TV , you know ,
[A] it 's just , uh ,
[A] local news concentrates , on murders and things like that .
[A] I 'm from Dallas
[A] and , uh , we have a lot of bad stuff , uh ,
-----
[A] it just really gets me depressed ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] even to watch it .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So then , you wake up one morning
[A] and you are in war with somebody
[A] you do n't even , even know about it .
[B] Right .
[A] So .
[B] Well , what newspapers , uh , do you read in Dallas ?
-----
[A] Uh , we have the DALLAS TIMES HERALD and the DALLAS MORNING NEWS ,
[A] but I do n't , I do n't read newspapers .
[B] Do n't you ?
-----
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] How come ?
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] I find it hard to , uh , follow from one page to another .
[A] It 's just something I have never developed , uh , an interest in .
[B] Huh .
[A] And I live in kind of a bad area where if I have the paper delivered it 's stolen before I can get out and get it .
[B] Gosh that 's , that sounds pretty bad to me .
[B] I mean who would steal a newspaper ?
[A] You would be surprised .
-----
[B] Huh ?
[A] They just come by and pick them up even if it 's just for the TV , you know t- , uh , selections of the day .
[B] I see .
[A] I do n't know .
-----
[A] It just would n't be there whenever I tried it .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So , you 're right ,
[A] who would steal a newspaper ?
[A] But , they do .
[B] Yeah .
[A] What part of California are you from ?
[B] Uh , from Los Angeles ,
-----
[B] but I live in Raleigh , North Carolina , right now ,
[B] that 's where I am speaking to you from .

[A] Huh , you work for T I ?
[B] No ,

[B] But , uh , I know some people at T I ,
[B] and I have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them .
[A] Yeah .
[B] So , I 'm in the computer business .
[A] Well , I ,

-----
[B] Well .
[A] I do n't keep up with it that often .
[B] Let 's see , I 've , I 've , I 've never done this before ,

[B] it seems to me it says you are suppose to talk for three minutes ,
[B] but I think we 've been talking for three minutes
[B] and nobody has interrupted .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well I , I got into a conversation last night with a lady
[A] and they interrupt at ten ,
-----
[B] I see .
[A] minutes .
[A] So if we 've done our three minutes .
