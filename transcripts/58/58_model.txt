[A] Okay ,
-----
[A] so what kind of car are you thinking about getting ?
[B] Well , none at the moment .
[A] Well , when you decide to .
[B] No ,
[B] no ,
[B] no .
[B] I currently drive a , a Ford Taurus .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And I would ima , I would imagine that if I change or if I get another car , a new car , I will go with the Taurus or something similar , uh , in that regard .
-----
[A] So you like the Ford ?
[B] Absolutely .
[B] I have had it for about two years now --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and it 's uh , it 's everything it 's supposed to be .
[B] Uh , I have n't had a minute 's trouble with it --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and , uh , the only thing I have against it in that 's it 's a Taurus ,
[B] but I still feel a little , even after two years , I still feel uncomfortable driving it , because I had a Honda before that --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and so it 's a little bit larger .
-----
[A] Right .
[B] But that 's the only , the only difference that I see , really .
[B] But I would ,
[B] my , my criteria would be , at the moment it would be , uh , American , uh , personally ,
[B] an ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it 's the ,
[A] this ,
[A] the car I had before this one was a Thunderbird --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- as a matter of fact ,
[A] and , uh , I loved it ,
[A] I really did .
[A] But , uh , um , I finally decided to go check out what the , uh , what the , uh , foreign cars were .
[A] So I bought myself a , a , a Nissan --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- a two forty S X .
[A] But even though I love the car I 've got now , I think my next car will probably be American again --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- because if I can at all do it , I 'd like to stay American ,
[A] I always have , up until now .
[A] I just for one time decided to go outside .
[A] So .
[B] Well , my wife drives a , still has a , a Honda --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- Accord ,
-----
[B] and it 's a very , it 's an excellent automobile .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , uh , but , you know , price and so forth ,
[B] I 'm not a real car fan .
[B] So , I , I , I do not , uh , opt for , uh , something that would be , you know , expensive --
[A] Right .
[B] -- you know ,
[B] I want , I want something that 's serviceable , serviceable , something that I can use --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and , uh , and I ,
[B] and with the Taurus ,
[B] I have a Taurus , uh , L X ,
[B] and it 's , you know ,
[B] you 're talking when you think about price , it 's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable Honda or Nissan or something along those lines .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And as I said , as far I 'm concerned , it , it has been extremely , uh , uh , serviceable and everything I wanted .
[A] Well , Ford 's done a real good job in the last , uh , say , ten years --
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- or at least the last five to te- , six years , so , of really turning around their , um , quality , I think , um .
[B] Oh , I think so too .
[B] Now , I , you know ,
[B] in travel and renting automobiles --
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- uh , in ,
[B] I 've driven , you know , Chevrolet automobiles and so for- , and Dodge ,
[B] and I ,
[B] if it 's Chevrolet , I just will not touch it .
[A] Um .
[B] Uh , I had a Chevrolet before I bought my Taurus .
[B] I purchased a , a Chevy , um , Citation .
[A] Oh , yeah ,
[A] those were not good cars .
[B] And , uh , I was ready to get rid of it two months after I bought it ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , uh , so I , I shopped around ,
[B] and I would , I probably , if I had thought I , uh , wanted to pay the amount of money , I probably would have gone with , uh , uh , an Accord --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- or even a , a Civic , or something comparable from Nissan --
[A] Right .
[B] -- or Toyota ,
[B] and , uh , but it was just ,
[B] I had , I have a friend who , uh , has a , uh , an auto shop ,
[B] and he purchased one of the first Sables that was , uh , manufactured for his wife , a Sable station wagon ,
[B] and he just absolutely swore by it .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And it was upon his recommendation and so forth for , you know , comparable , comparably equipped , you know , with cruise control and air conditioning and A M F M radio , and all these other things --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- uh , it was just ,
-----
[B] there was no , there was no comparison . Uh ,
[B] the only thing that I find , you know , if I would have anything against it is that it still has that soft American ride .
[A] Right .
[B] Uh , not , uh ,
[B] that 's about the only thing I find , you know , disadvantageous to it .
[B] But , my criteria , is simply something that looks good , something that 's serviceable ,
[B] and I , you know , I drive around a lot ,
[B] but , uh , and it 's , you know , it 's very comfortable on the highway .
[B] I can drive for , you know , ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But those are my criteria ,
[B] and I , I probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again ,
[B] and if there 's something out there that , uh , is comparable to what I have now , I 'll go ahead and get it .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] You know , the only thing I 'm looking ,
[A] at right now , um ,
[A] I just , I just bought , you know , the Nissan that I 've got about , uh , say , nine months ago ,
-----
[A] I guess it was .
[A] So the only thing that , that would get me to change cars right now would be if ,
[A] see , at the moment I 'm single ,
[A] and if I were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it .
[A] But , uh , I do n't have any plans for probably another two , three years of even looking , you know .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Uh , cars are too expensive right now to , uh --
[B] I ,
[B] yeah .
[A] -- to even think about buying new cars every couple of years , you know
[A] it 's
[B] In our parking lots , uh , two or three days ago I saw one of the new Honda sports cars .
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Uh , I , I ca n't remember what the name is .
[B] It 's the thirty-five or forty thousand dollar one , whatever it is ,
[B] and it looked , it resembled a Mazaratti --
[A] Um .
[B] -- very , very closely .
[B] And it 's an absolutely beautiful automobile --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and well appointed and so forth ,
[B] but to pay that much money for an automobile , uh , is just ,
[B] I ca n't , I ca n't conceive of doing that .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's , uh ,
[A] I went to a , a car show down here about , uh , about two weeks ago ,
-----
[A] and , um , you know , of course they had the normal , the Ford , the , the Chevrolet , that stuff .
[A] But then you started looking at the , uh , uh ,
[A] they had Ferrari there , they had , uh , B M W and all these other kinds of cars .
[A] And Ferrari did n't even let you near the car ,
[A] I mean , they were ,
[A] that 's how expensive they were .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And then you saw , uh , hundred thousand dollar cars ,
[A] you saw eighty thousand dollar cars ,
[A] and even , even though I , I , I do enjoy cars , I enjoy , um , driving them , I enjoy , uh , riding in them and everything , but , I ca n't see buying , or paying more for a car than I would for a house , you know .
[B] That 's true . Well ,
[A] That does n't seem likely .
-----
[B] The difference there is , too , uh , is between us is that I am not really crazy about driving .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I never have been , since , you know , my parents had to force me to get my driver 's license when I was young --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- when I was sixteen .
[B] So I 've never really cared .
[B] Now , what I was , you know ,
[B] before I was married and before I went to graduate school , I used to do little sports car racing .
[B] I never , it was never my own car --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- it was always someone else 's .
[B] And that sort of thing I enjoy ,
[B] but to go out and drive , uh , never has really been , had any appeal to me --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- in that regard .
[B] So . Well I guess we 've discussed that enough
[B] do n't you think .
[A] I think so .
-----
[B] We wo n't , we do n't , we wo n't get the recorder or the , uh , system to shut us off , uh , tonight .
[B] That 's happened to me almost every time I 've ,
[A] That 's happened to me once ,
-----
[A] So , uh ,
[B] Well , it 's very easy when you get a top- , you get on a topic that , you know , you enjoy .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] like , uh , I think the one time I did it was on Sau- , the Mid , the Mid East , the crisis out there .
[B] Oh , yeah .
[A] That was , had a great conversation ,
[A] but , uh , then they came off and told us we could n't do it any more .
[A] So .
[B] Well I was talking to a lady last evening ,
[B] and we were talking about fishing ,
[B] and , uh , we were cut off , well ,
[B] we were told to quit .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Okay .
[B] Well , you have a pleasant evening .
[A] You too .
-----
[B] Take care .
[A] Bye-bye .
[B] Good-bye .
