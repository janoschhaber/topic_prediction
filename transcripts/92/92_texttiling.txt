[A] Okay ,
[A] so which , uh , what basketball teams are you interested in ?
[B] Well , I guess I 'm a big Laker , L A Laker fan ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] when it comes to pros .
[B] Uh , the college ranks , um , I guess I really ,
[B] of course I try to follow my alma mater ,
[B] that 's , uh , B Y U ,
[A] Uh-huh
[B] in Utah .
[B] But they do n't have much of a team usually .
[A] No ,
[A] they 're more of a football team than they are basketball team .
[B] Yeah ,
-----
[B] yeah .
[B] You see them in football on T V once in awhile .
[A] Yeah .
[B] You never see them on a , on nationally basketball .
[A] You know , that 's true .
[A] I do n't think I 've ever seen them nationally on basketball .
[B] They , uh , last year they had a really good team ,
[B] MUMBLEx the year that Danny Aines was there .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] That was about five , six years ago by now .
[A] Huh .
[B] So , they made it to the sweet sixteen ,
[A] Um .
[B] once or twice ,
[A] That 's not too bad .
[B] in their history ,
[B] and that 's ,
[B] and they usually lose in the first round .
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] MUMBLEx .
[B] How about you ?
[A] Well , I 'm , uh , originally from the Saint Louis area ,
[A] so the only basketball team , pro anyway , in that part of the country is Chicago .
[A] So , I , I do pull for Chicago .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I mean , of course , this year is a good year to be a , a Chicago B- , fan , I guess , because they 're doing pretty good .
[B] Is it the Bulls you 're talking about ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] the pro ,
[A] Um , as far as college teams , uh , I know it 's really easy to say ,
[A] but I 've been pulling for , uh , Duke for about four years now
[A] so , uh ,
[B] Is that right ?
[A] so , I finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams . Although , I 've , I 've really , you know ,
[A] again being from Saint Louis , I pull for Missouri .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Uh , but they 're on , uh , probation this year
[A] so you ca n't do much about that .
[B] No ,
[B] no .
[A] But , uh ,
[B] So , did you watch the , uh , final four this year ?
[A] Oh , yeah .
[A] I watched every , uh ,
[B] Every game ?
[A] I watched all three games of that .
[A] And , uh , I was very pleased with all three games , because Kansas , uh ,
[A] you know , I was pulling for Kansas on the other side ,
[A] so it was real nice to have the , the teams that were there .
[B] Right ,
[B] right .
[A] Of course , I was n't really ,
[A] I mean , I , I ,
[A] U N L V kind of gave me the impression of being a , uh , uh , oh , I do n't know , a macho team , you know ,
[A] they just did n't seem , they seemed to think they were better than everybody else
[A] and , and maybe they were ,
[A] but , um , I was real happy to see them get knocked off .
[A] So ,
[B] Yeah .
[B] I , I watched that game .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and , uh , it was a good game .
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] It was a very close game , and hard fought game .
[B] And it just ,
[B] I do n't know ,
[B] it looked like U N L V may have had more , uh , talent ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] but , as far as playing together as a team that day , it did n't , Duke seemed to have them off balance .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And that , uh , they did n't , could n't ,
[B] are n't they more of a running gun team MUMBLEx ?
[A] U N L V ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] they , they play the pro style , is ,
[B] Right .
[A] what I 've always called it .
[A] And , uh ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] fast breaks and things and ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] the fast breaks and , and ,
[B] They shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed
[B] and ,
[A] Right .
[A] And , uh , U N L V was n't used to that .
[A] Of course , I 've , I knew whenever U N L V went in at half time , MUMBLEx
[A] see I do n't know if they were necessarily behind ,
[A] but they were n't ahead as much as they normally are .
[B] Right .
[A] Uh , and , you know , that meant that they had to play a second half
[A] and they , they 've not had to do that all year
[A] and , uh ,
[B] Right ,
[B] right .
[B] They did n't have , they did n't have to go through some tough games during the year
[B] and that , and that , so that 's a terrible time to have to deal with that , right in , when it , when it counts so much .
[A] That 's right .
[A] I mean Duke 's schedule was , was so much harder than U N L V 's that it , uh , it just made them a much tougher team overall ,
[B] Right .
[A] and , uh , that had to help them a lot .
[B] I think , I think that , that probably was the difference in that game .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Because it really could have gone an- , either way . Down to the end , you know .
[A] So do I take it that you think though that the Lakers will , uh ,
[B] Well ,
[A] will win
[A] or ,
[B] I do n't know .
[B] Probably not .
[A] I mean , Portland 's pretty good . Um ,
[B] Since Kareem 's retired ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] they have n't had a center .
[B] And , uh , they 've got Perkins ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] but I do n't think he 's really been a super star for them .
[A] No .
[A] Well , he 's , uh ,
[A] I do n't ,
[A] I ,
[A] he , he to me is not a center ,
[A] he 's more of a ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] a real tall forward .
[B] Right ,
[B] right .
[A] Uh ,
[B] So ,
[A] I think Magic does a ,
[B] They 'll make it , you know ,
[B] i- , i- , it , it 's going to be a war between , uh , between Chicago and , uh , and , uh , uh , Boston Celtics .
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] That 's going to be a war .
[A] That sure is .
[A] It ,
[B] It 's going to be a great series .
[A] I think that 's going to be one of those that 's , uh , that 's won by the home team , you know ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one I think .
[B] One of those two will probably be , um , in there ,
[B] um , let me see ,
[B] where does Detroit fit in ?
[A] Detroit 's in that same , uh , that , that same , uh , division .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] So , I do n't know ,
[B] those three ,
[B] uh , Detroit has n't been having that great a year this year .
[A] No ,
[A] but as I heard , Isaiah came back this week .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] So , uh , that might help them .
[B] Yeah .
[B] They have the , they have the play-off experience ,
[B] but ,
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] so does Detroit , I mean , so does Chicago . So do , all three of them do ,
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] with Larry Bird back , uh ,
[B] you can never count the Celtics out when Larry Bird 's ,
[A] That 's true .
[B] starting to click on all cylinders .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] They say he 's starting to do , starting to play ,
[A] He 's , yeah but he 's been , yeah , but he 's been kind of up and down all year .
[B] Right .
[A] uh , one game and he 'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in
[A] and then the next time he 'll ,
[B] Right .
[A] you know , he ca n't seem to hit the side of a barn .
[A] So , I do n't know ,
[B] Right .
[A] I 'm , I 'm kind of , I 'm not sure about him this year .
[B] Last I 've heard is that he 's starting to peak right now .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Well that 's when ,
[B] He 's ,
[A] you do it .
[B] starting to be more consistent , you know , right at the right time of the year .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Oh , any dark horses I , uh , you know ,
[A] Well , the dark horses ,
[B] San Antonio ,
[A] Yeah
[A] that 's ,
[B] San Antonio is the dark horse that could , could really flip in there , I think .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Well , anybody who has David Robinson ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] has got to have a chance anyway .
[B] He 's got to be pretty much , you know ,
[B] I use to say Akimo Lija was the dominant player , you know , when he ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] against any team he would dominate ,
[B] but Robinson 's getting up there where ,
[A] That 's right .
[B] every game , he 's just ,
[B] I mean , it looks like he 's going in for a dunk
[B] and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back , you know ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] nobody 's got enough beef , I guess , to challenge him when he 's , when he 's driving hard to the hoop .
[A] Huh .
[B] He 's , uh , he 's ,
[B] too bad the Mavericks could n't get him .
[A] That 's true .
[B] With Roy Tarpley they 're in big trouble .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Well then , he 's gone now
[A] so ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] for awhile anyway .
[A] they do n't have to worry about that .
[A] Well , I thought he was gone period .
[A] I , I did n't read the story ,
[A] but I , I , read that , uh ,
[B] I heard he was suspended .
[A] Well , that might have been what it was ,
[B] Because of his ,
[A] but I , I guess the headlines said something about him , you know , that the Mavericks released him or something ,
[A] I , maybe I misunderstood what they meant .
[B] Um . If they did , they 'd still have to pay his contract .
[A] Well , yeah --
[B] They may have done it .
[A] -- you never know .
[B] It was a lot of money .
[B] He was making like ,
[A] Yeah
[A] but ,
[B] I heard on the radio it was sixty-three thousand and change a month .
[B] That 's what he was being paid , you know ,
[B] he was n't even playing .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Oh , boy , what a good job he had .
[A] That 's what I think .
[B] He ruined his sweet position .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I 'm looking forward to the , the pro play-off , uh ,
[A] Yeah .
[A] It 's coming up , is n't it .
[B] L A ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] San Antonio ,
[B] who 's the other one that 's doing so well this year ,
[B] Port- , is that Portland ?
[A] Portland .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] Portland .
[B] Portland .
[B] I have n't seen them on much T V that much at all ,
[B] but all I can do is hear about ,
[B] boy they have the seeing eye .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] What do they have
[B] Walter Davis and ,
[A] They 've got two , the two Johnson brothers
[A] or they 're not brothers ,
[A] but I mean there 's two guys named Johnson on their team that are really good or doing good or something ,
[A] I forget how that works .
[A] But ,
[B] Um .
[A] um , like I said they 're doing extremely good right now .
[A] Phoenix is n't doing too bad .
[A] So ,
[B] Right .
[B] Right .
[A] It , it ought to be a real interesting play-off .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I do n't think there 's any clear pick , you know .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I guess the two teams that you ca n't count out are the Celtics because of Bird , and the Lakers because of Magic Johnson .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] They are two guys that seem to find a way when they ,
[A] When it 's on the line .
[B] When it 's on the line , they seem to find a way .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] You know ,
[B] uh , so , those are what makes a champion I guess .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's true .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Well , it 's been nice talking to you .
[B] Nice talking to you .
[A] All right .
[A] Take care .
[B] Take care .
[B] Bye .
