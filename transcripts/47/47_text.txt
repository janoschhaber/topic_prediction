[A] Okay .
[B] So are you a freshwater or ,
[A] Mostly freshwater ,
[A] I --
[B] Freshwater ,
[A] -- yeah ,
[A] I , I used to fish , uh , when I was real young , down in Galveston with my parents ,
[A] and I never really got into that too much , because you have to get in the boat really to do anything ,
[A] and I did n't know anybody who had a boat now ,
[A] so I do n't fish too much in saltwater .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Most of my fishing has been in the saltwater .
[A] Oh , really ,
[B] Uh , mostly deep sea fishing for grouper and bottom fish --
[A] Oh , neat ,
[B] -- and , uh , I have caught one or two small sharks --
[A] Oh , really .
[B] -- and , uh , yes .
[A] What 'd you do with them ?
[B] Put them back .
[A] You did n't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do ?
[B] No ,
[B] no ,
[B] no ,
[B] I love shark steak ,
[B] but , uh , the ones I caught were never large enough to really do anything .
[A] Do they have a limit on sharks ,
[A] I mean , is that like a , a sport fish ,
[A] can you actually catch those
[A] and there 's no limit .
[B] Is there a limit ?
[B] I have no idea .
[B] I know , I ,
[B] my home is in , uh , Pensacola , Florida --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- so , it 's , they do a lot of shark fishing in that , you know , in the gulf --
[A] Right .
[B] -- and , um , there 's a certain period of time during the year they have all along the gulf coast from , I guess from Galveston to Mayport they have , uh , shark tournaments ,
[B] and , you know , there 's part ,
[B] either as part of or separate from the , uh , bill fishing tournaments they usually have --
[A] Right .
[B] -- so , I have not done , uh , much freshwater fishing --
[A] Oh , really .
[B] -- oh , for , you know , lake , lake fishing for bass and so forth --
[A] Right .
[B] -- but , uh , maybe some what they call brim --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and those sorts of things , but nothing ,
[B] I think I 've been trout fishing once .
[B] I 've never fly fished .
[B] Have you fly fished ?
[A] Uh , no
[A] I have n't .
[A] I do n't know that I could do that .
[A] That looks awful tiring .
[B] I 've tried it --
[A] Did you .
[B] -- once ,
[B] yes ,
[B] uh , a friend of mine --
[A] Did n't like it ?
[B] -- no .
[B] I could never get the hang of it .
[A] It looks complicated to me .
[A] It 's a rhythm or something .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] I usually ended snagging my , uh , fishing partners or the trees along the bank .
[A] Catching tree bass ,
[A] right .
[B] Yes .
[B] Almost got an owl once .
[A] Did you .
[A] That would have been something .
[B] But , uh .
[A] So do you , do you fish mainly for trophies
[A] or do you , do you eat what you fish .
[B] Oh , no ,
[B] no ,
[B] no ,
[B] no .
[B] I used , uh , when I was , uh , working in Florida , I used to do a lot of surf fishing --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- mostly for relaxation --
[A] Right .
[B] -- you know , there are people who fish ,
[B] and then there are people who catch .
[A] Right .
[B] Well , I 'm a fisher .
[A] You just like to sit down and watch it , right .
[B] That 's right ,
[B] I 've never caught that much ,
[B] but , uh ,
[A] Really .
[B] Oh , and occasionally we 'd go out on a , you know , full day trip , you know , three or four other people --
[A] Right .
[B] -- and do either , again , bottom fishing or --
[A] Right .
[B] -- or for grouper
[B] or , I used to catch you know , I 've caught a few worthwhile snappers , red snappers and gray snappers and so forth .
[A] That 's nice .
[B] What about you , you a ,
[A] Well , most of my fishing is done at , um , area lakes around here , freshwater lakes --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and , um , most of it ,
[A] I have n't been really in a long time .
[A] Last time I went I actually was in Galveston trying to saltwater fish
[A] and it just was n't working with my freshwater tackle .
[A] That was real fun .
[A] Um , but , um , I went fishing at , I do n't know if you 've ever heard of , uh , Lake Worth .
[A] It 's a fairly new lake in Texas .
[B] Oh , yes .
[A] And , uh , we went fishing there last memorial day ,
[A] and I caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep .
[A] I was so excited .
[A] And , uh , that 's really about it .
[A] Mostly just the lakes around here ,
[A] and I fish to take home and cook .
[A] I do n't , I do n't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching .
[A] I get a little bit of relaxation from it ,
[A] but mainly I , um , I want to say I brought something home .
[A] I want to say I did this ,
[A] I was out there for a reason .
[B] The last time I went , uh , bass fishing ,
[B] I was with my daughter , a friend of hers , and , well , a friend of mine and his daughter .
[B] We , I was the only one who did not catch ,
[B] a single fish --
[A] Really .
[B] -- my daughter caught fish ,
[B] his daughter caught fish ,
[B] he caught fish .
[A] Everybody but you .
[B] I did not even , I did not even ,
[B] I have been , I was out on a party boat a few years ago ,
[B] and we , we were grouper fishing ,
[B] or , you know , actually we were , uh , snapper fishing .
[B] Everyone on the boat was catching snapper , snappers except guess who .
[A] It had to be you .
[B] I ca- , I ,
[A] Could n't catch one to save your life . Huh .
[B] That 's right ,
[B] I would go from one side of the boat to the other ,
[B] and , uh ,
[B] the , uh , the party boat captain could not understand , you know ,
[B] he even , even he started baiting my hook ,
[B] and holding , holding the , uh , the fishing rod .
[A] How funny ,
[A] just hoping maybe , he could pull .
[B] Right ,
[B] and it was , it was really , really , really bad .
[B] Uh , I , as I said , I am a fisher ,
[B] I 'm not a catcher .
[A] Right .
[B] But , uh , I enjoy it though .
[B] I do n't really get out as much as I , uh , as I would like too .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And they do , of course , you know ,
[B] here in ,
[B] we 're only just a few , not a few minutes , we 're , you know , forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in Maryland --
[A] Right .
[B] -- and they do a lot of fishing there .
[B] Of course what I used to like to do though is go snorkeling for scallops --
[A] Oh , yeah ,
[B] -- in some of the bays , or uh , or oy- , for oysters .
[A] That would be fun .
[B] And , uh , that I was able to do , when I could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom .
[A] Right .
[A] Hand picked .
[B] That right .
[A] The weirdest fishing experience I ever had . People to this day are still trying to figure out if I really caught what I think I caught .
[A] We were in , uh , Rockport , which is close to Corpus --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and we had been fishing in a canal ,
[A] they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area ,
[A] and , uh , we 'd been fishing in the canals
[A] and all we were catching were catfish ,
[A] and we were pretty bored with that .
[A] So , we thought well , maybe there are some crab in here ,
[A] we 'll try to catch some crab .
[A] So I got my chicken MUMBLEx and all my little net and everything ,
[A] and something ,
[A] I had a rock to weight it down ,
[A] something grabs and just runs with it .
[A] And of course there 's no hook ,
[A] so it ca n't be a fish .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I 'm sure it 's not a fish ,
[A] right .
[A] And crab , they do n't bite like that ,
[A] they do n't just run with your food .
[A] So , I netted it ,
[A] and it was the ugliest fish I 've ever seen in my life .
[A] It had real teeth , like human teeth ,
[A] and it looked archaic .
[A] I , I had no idea what it was .
[A] I called my father long distance just to describe the thing ,
[A] and it had the rock in its mouth , not the chicken ,
[A] but the rock itself --
[B] Um .
[A] -- is what it had grabbed .
[A] They say it 's a dog fish , from everything I 've described ,
[A] it was brown with these little white dots --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and it made a loud , almost a croaking noise like a croaker does --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- it , it was the strangest thing .
[A] Oh , I 'll never get over that .
[A] To this day I do n't want to get in the water ,
[A] anywhere around salt water because I 'm sure one of those fish are there .
[B] Well , we used to ,
[B] I guess the weirdest thing I 've ever caught is , uh , in some of the inlets and the rivers around MUMBLEx Delaware .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] They have a fish that 's called an oyster cracker .
[B] I do n't know if you 've ever heard of it --
[A] I 've never heard of that one .
[B] -- and it has a huge strong mouth ,
[B] and they actually , uh , use their teeth to open oysters .
[A] That 's where it gets its name , obviously , huh .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] and this is the ugliest ,
[B] fish I have ever seen ,
[B] and I mean , and they come in all si- , you know ,
[B] I 've , I 've caught them from , you know , three or four inches long --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- up to , uh ,
[B] I guess the largest one I ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long ,
[B] but just huge , ugly things --
[A] Huh .
[B] -- just terrible .
[A] Can you eat them ?
[B] No ,
[B] no .
[A] Ooh .
[A] I , I do n't think I 'd want to even if you could if they 're that ugly ,
[A] but .
[B] They just , they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them .
[A] That 's like this dog fish ,
[A] it was , it scared me to death .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] It was u- , it really , it did n't look like , it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died .
[B] Well , the first time I went surf fishing was in MUMBLEx ,
[B] and I threw my line out
[B] and the first thing I caught was a sand shark , which was probably a foot ,
[B] and a half or , uh , two feet long ,
[B] and scared me to death .
[A] Oh .
[B] I had never seen anything ,
[B] and then I was fi , fished for another half hour or forty-five minutes , caught a few white fish and so forth ,
[B] and then I felt something relatively heavy ,
[B] and I thought , oh , really , here , I 'm really going to get one .
[B] And I ,
