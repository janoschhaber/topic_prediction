[A] Okay ,
-----
[A] do you want to go first ?
[B] Well , I could barely hear what the switchboard operator was saying as what was the topic .
[A] Fitness and exercise .
[B] Oh , God .
[B] No ,
[B] why do n't you go first .
[A] Okay ,
[A] um , I like to do , uh , weight training and , and cycling . And just walking , uh , swimming .
-----
[A] I used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until I had some knee surgery last fall .
[A] And the doctor said that running and jumping is n't real good for my knee anymore ,
[A] so I had to kind of change my life-style a little bit .
[B] Well , let me ask a personal question ,
-----
[B] how old are you ?
[A] Thirty-eight .
[B] Oh , well then you should
[B] see over thirty-five everything goes downhill flop .
[A] Well , the rest of me is in pretty good shape
-----
[A] it 's just that left knee that just does n't want to do everything it used to .
[B] Oh , you 're lucky then
[B] because I 've battled arthritis all my life ,
[A] Really ?
[B] I mean even since I was like about two or three .
[A] Oh .
[B] Then they diagnosed it ,
[B] and usually most people are just absolutely crippled ,
[B] and , uh , I do water aerobics .
[A] Oh , I bet that helps .
-----
[B] Religiously do water aerobics ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I used to do it about six times a week
[B] and now I 'm down to about four
[B] but it 's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in sh- , in there ,
[B] uh , I tried weight training
[B] and I 'm telling you , you just , I just ca n't lift the things .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And the shock on the system is , is just too much ,
[B] so I have stuck to water aerobics basically , you know , the weightless thing and ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] trying to keep this shape that way
[B] but , you know , it 's hard to find .
[B] I mean it 's really hard to find a place that 's going to offer water aerobics because what I 'm finding is that if they do offer it , you get the crowd of women that are , ,
[B] I think they feel this is going to be an effortless sweatless way ,
[A] That 's right .
[B] to get in shape ,
[A] That 's right .
[B] without having to spend anything
[B] or it 's the geriatric crowd .
[A] That 's right .
[B] So , I 've considered even becoming licensed to teach it .
[A] Well , I mean , if , if you know what your routine is , you can do that by yourself ,
-----
[A] and you probably do .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] but you have to have an indoor pool .
[A] This is true .
[B] So , to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without , you know , drawing a lot of looks , means you 're really going to do a strenuous workout activity MUMBLEx
[B] you look very odd in the water ,
-----
[A] Well , that ,
[B] that was the one place where I was also able to do weight training ,
[B] and that does look very odd in the water .
[A] I can believe that .
-----
[A] Have you tried the , uh , the pool at the Spring Creek Fitness Center ?
[B] No ,
[B] and you know , that 's the only place I have n't tried
[B] and people have told me .
[B] Now that 's the Texins facility ?
[A] Yes .
[B] I have been told that thing is just lovely .
-----
[A] It is .
[A] They keep it at eighty-one degrees year-round .
[B] Huh .
[B] He- ,
[B] do you use that facility a lot ?
[A] Um , a fairly , a fairly good amount , uh , more on the weekends ,
[A] uh , I try to beat the traffic in the mornings when I workout in the mornings , I try to come down to the Dallas Fitness Center .
[B] Huh .
[B] Do you know if they have child care there ?
[A] Um , have you done your attitude survey for this year yet ?
[A] You need to put that on there , seriously .
[B] They do n't ,
[B] I do n't , I do n't work at T I .
[A] Oh , you do n't ?
-----
[B] No ,
[B] I used to work at T I ,
[A] Oh .
[B] as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position
[B] actually when I was working there I was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry ,
[B] and I used to fill out those attitude surveys ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and , uh , uh , me and the insurance adjusters are , are very familiar with each other
[B] and my husband still works there ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and
[B] , um , I get my attitude expressed through them , but
[B] I find it to be very sometimes
[B] it 's kind of shoot yourself in the foot short- , MUMBLEx mentality to save a few bucks .
[A] This is true .
[B] Uh , and never having lived in Texas before I starting working for T I
[B] and I came down here
-----
[B] and , you know , they did an attitude survey like six weeks after I had been working here
[B] and I asked about , you know , day care for the shift workers ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and boy I was pulled in by my manager and told that you just do n't say that , you know ,
[A] Well , it 's not ,
-----
[B] it was not applicable to me
[B] and I was kind of horrified .
[A] Now what year are we talking about ?
-----
[B] We 're talking nineteen seventy-eight .
[A] Okay ,
[A] uh , things have become much more enlightened since then .
[B] They could n't have gotten anymore in the dark ages .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] you know , we still do n't have a day care facility
[A] but people are more sympathetic to it .
-----
[B] I understand , I understand that they 're now covering women 's preventative health care ,
[A] Yes .
[A] Yes .
[B] and , uh , the reason I 'm at home is when I had my kids , and I was scheduled to go back and I tell you how much in the dark ages it was . Um , I had been rated number one in the field
[B] and then I took , uh ,
[B] when I became pregnant I also got meningitis ,
[A] Oh .
[B] and then delivered the first baby three months early ,
[A] My gosh .
[B] and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when I took her home ,
[B] and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment .
[A] Could you hold the phone for one second ,
[B] Sure .
[A] Thanks .
[A] Okay ,
[A] I 'm back .
[B] And then they used to , uh ,
-----
[B] and then I had a second one eighteen months later ,
[B] they told me to put them back to back
[B] and , of course , to maintain
[B] and I was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one ,
[A] Wow .
[B] because that 's when I go into labor MUMBLEx four and a half months
[B] and I do n't even know it .
[A] Of course it 's real easy to take care of the first one when you 're on your back .
[B] Oh , yeah ,
[B] very easy ,
[B] very easy
[B] and they , they put me on twenty-four hour fetal monitoring then to , to try to control the labor and see how far it was going ,
-----
[B] and after the baby was born , since it was n't premature , then they said they would n't cover the cost of the monitor .
[B] I think that 's kind of when my husband hit the roof ,
[A] Really .
[B] because it was a , uh , thirteen thousand dollar bill ,
[B] but after the second baby was born I was going to go back to work ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and that was when they had ,
[B] God it would have been the eighty-five layoff ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and I 'll tell you how they handled this
[B] and I was just outraged ,
[B] I did not know that since I was on personal leave of absence that I had been , uh , terminated until I filed my insurance claims about four months later
[B] and they did n't have any coverage under my name
[B] and I went back
[B] and I said what the hell is going on here , you know .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] really .
[B] And they told me that , uh , oh , well , you know , you know , your husband works here
[B] and he 's got a good salary
[B] we did n't think that you 'd be coming back anyway ,
[B] and , uh , you know , we 've got people here that really , you know , need to be working
[B] and so that we had just ,
[B] you know , it was , this way we did n't have to layoff an active person
[B] and we 'd just let you go .
[B] And it took me about a year of arguing ,
[B] I said , you know , I 've got to put this in writing to me ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and because until they put it in writing , I could n't get my insurance benefits
[B] and I could n't get my , uh , termination benefits either .
[A] There you go .
-----
[B] I was just pissed as hell that they could do that .
[A] I , I can believe that .
[B] But I , I guess things have gotten better ,
[B] I 've been told that this flex hour and those kind of things ,
[A] Oh , yeah ,
[A] flex time is great .
[B] I still do n't think that , they after my experiences that they could , you know , get me to go back , ever again .
[A] I , I can understand .
[A] I can understand .
[A] Well , it 's been good talking with you .
[B] But let me ask you this , since you use Texans ,
-----
[B] how much is it a month ?
[A] Oh , shoot it 's only about ten bucks a month .
[B] Now that 's for individual .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I mean , uh , to add dependents is , is you know , maybe another dollar or something
[A] it 's no big deal .
[B] That 's it ?
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] Now if you , if you pay your monthly charge , do you then pay separately for classes you 're taking ?
[A] Uh , you do for classes , for classes ,
[A] but to , I mean to use any of the facilities is , is no extra charge .
-----
[B] God , that 's cheap .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it is .
[B] That 's really cheap .
-----
[B] Do you have to be an active T I employee to join Texans or ,
[A] Or , or a depe- ,
[A] or a dependent of one .
[B] Or a depe- ,
[B] God , I am so dependent these days .
-----
[A] Really .
[B] It 's a sense MUMBLEx .
[B] Oh , MUMBLEx seen that my , my co-dependents have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbor 's fence .
[A] Wonderful .
[B] Yeah .
[B] So my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment
[B] but boy , I think I 'm going to go contact Texans .
[B] I really think I am ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] I mean , that beats any offer I 've heard in a long time .
[A] Oh , yeah ,
[A] it 's great .
[B] Huh .
[B] All righty .
-----
[B] When you 're there on weekends is it crowded as hell ?
[A] Uh , well , it would depend on when you go
[A] it 's not , it 's not excessively crowded on the weekends .
-----
[B] See I 'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty .
[A] Oh , I do n't think that would be bad at all .
[A] If you 're in Richardson you 'd probably wanted to come to the , to the Dallas site .
-----
[B] Oh , I 'm actually right on the Plano line .
[A] Oh , well , then you could go either one ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern , has a lot more niceties , amenities
-----
[A] and you 'd probably like the pool there .
[B] Oh , God it sounds like I would .
[B] I might do that then .
[B] Okay ,
[B] I learned something here .
[A] Well , good .
-----
[A] I 'm glad .
[B] You can go back to work now .
[A] Well , thank you .
[B] Thank you .
-----
[A] You have a good day .
[B] Bye-bye .
[A] Bye-bye .
