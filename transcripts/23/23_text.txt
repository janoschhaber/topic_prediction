[A] You want to start ?
[B] Well , I guess I would first identify myself as middle aged
[B] and therefore ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] having seen the last generation , I guess it puts me in , you know , gives me a perspective on that .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Uh , I , am quite positive on the things that I have seen happen recently relative to women in , both in society and in the work place ,
[B] uh , there 's no doubt about the fact that when I was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman 's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office , but not necessarily .
[B] Uh , now I think the change that I 've seen as much as anything is one where couples , uh , are more carefully planning their intention on how to both share homemaking duties and also how women will , uh , have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And I guess that 's a significant change that I 've both participated in an- , and noticed .
[A] I agree , uh ,
[A] the equality of , uh , the roles now between the sexes , I guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war , especially compared with , uh , the Vietnam war
[A] and you see women going off to wars as well as men .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Uh , I have wondered why they allowed , or let , you know , both the father and mother go , uh ,
[A] and the children are left without either parent .
[A] Now to me that 's kind of a drawback .
[A] But , uh , I guess it 's a price you pay .
[A] And I also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the , uh , uh , day care centers .
[B] Wonder about them in what way ?
[A] Well , uh , from what I understand there 's been studies that , uh , these children are , uh , more rebellious .
[A] Uh , they term it as more , uh , creative .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] But , uh , that they , uh , are much more contentious .
[A] So , I , I do n't , I , I guess we 'll have to see another generation to see what differences a child being brought up , you know , in a , uh , kind of a , uh , community ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] rather than a home .
[B] I have not , to be honest , had much experience ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] with children in that situation .
[B] I , I guess one knows one 's own storly
[B] and I know , uh , in my children 's case it was one where , uh , pretty much up until the older of two was in , uh , let 's see , I guess basically starting junior high
[B] and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Uh ,
[A] So they ,
[B] so I guess my experience is , is just with what we did
[B] and , and so they did n't really go through the child care route .
[A] Yeah .
[B] They were able to be home together .
[B] Uh , and we never actually experienced that .
[B] What , in terms of changes relative to women in the work place and the potential changes over the , the next generation or so , I guess I anticipate , uh , an increasing equality , uh , greater presence of women in management roles --
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] -- uh , I do n't know whether there will be an increased amount of , of surrogacy that we see .
[B] I just do n't know .
[A] What do you mean ?
[B] Uh , deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother .
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] Sort of rent-a-mom ,
[B] to be , you know ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] not to be crass about it , but , uh ,
[A] That 's strange .
[B] uh , whether one might conceive , no pun intended , of the possibility that there might be a kind of a deliberate , uh , uh --
[A] A nanny , sort of ?
[B] -- a professional mother , a- ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] person .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] For instance , that ,
[B] and I could , you know , I could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting , uh , uh , story or whatever .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I , I do n't think I have a philosophical problem with that .
[B] In fact , I think it sort of raises nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession .
[A] That 's right ,
[A] that 's right .
[B] Uh , I , I do n't have a , other than , than a reading and , and male perspective on , on the ver- , on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not .
[B] Uh , I know that , that my sense is that I have very much an interest and had one in being a parent .
[B] I , I do n't know that I , uh , felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Uh , I do n't have boys ,
[B] that does n't , did n't bother me ,
[B] never has .
[B] Vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy or , or as a professional nanny , nanny as you put it , uh .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Maybe we 'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of , say , taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] It would be a sort of day care ,
[B] but it would be more of a family setting .
[A] Right .
[B] Uh , I know that there are young people , characterized , I guess as being half my age , so that by definition that means ,
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] they 're young . Uh , that , in my work place , who are both of them earning rather decent professional salaries who probably would consider paying a woman , uh , eight or nine or ten thousand dollars a year to take care of their child ,
[A] To come in and live with them ?
[B] I could easily envision that .
[B] Pardon ?
[A] To come in and live with them ?
[B] Or to put their child into a s- , into a home setting ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] where they would , you know , like they , they would get , leave at eight in the morning and , and drop a two year old off in a home where you knew there were going to be four other kids
[B] and ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and you were paying for really high quality care .
[A] Right .
[B] Uh , I have acquaintances of mine where I know that they are paying figures on , on the order of what I quoted to someone , because that 's what the experience they want
[B] and I would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that , that 's a possibility of a change --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- that we could see in the next few years .
[A] And then you might have more control over , uh , the , the morals that they would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] uh-huh .
[A] I know the day care centers are not cheap either .
[A] You know they 're ,
[B] I have n't ever really looked at them .
[B] Are you aware at all ,
[A] Uh , well , no ,
[B] of , of what they would , what they cost ?
[A] I just know , I know several single mothers who absolutely ca n't afford it .
[A] They have to go with the , a single , uh , wh- , I mean a baby-sitter more , more or less .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] But I think it 's like , about sixty dollars a week for two children --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- if I 'm not mistaken .
[A] And you have to pay that whether you 're on vacation , you know , and taking care of the children or if the children are at home , at home ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] sick .
[A] I mean , that is , you know , just a , a rate that you have to pay
[A] and , uh ,
[B] What , what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in American society ?
[A] Uh , I think , I really do n't have a vision .
[B] That 's okay , too .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I , I , I think that they will be more in the work place because , uh , the door 's open .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , uh , it 's just human nature to walk through an open door .
[A] So , and I would be glad to see that .
[A] I hope I do n't see a lot more single moms ,
[A] but ,
[B] MUMBLEx .
[A] i- , it seems in my experience I 'm running across single women all the time .
[B] I 'm , I 'm noticing that , too ,
[B] and , and I notice the , the , a terming ex- , em , emerging called solo parents ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] that I 'm very aware of the number of solo mothers that , that I encounter in the work place ,
[B] and that , that is a little troublesome .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[B] Uh , because the pressures on them are , are ,
[A] It 's awful .
[B] rather , rather formidable .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Uh , and maybe that 's a change we 'll see .
[B] Maybe , uh , the possibility of , of women , uh , who deliberately say , no ,
[B] we 'll let the man will take care of the children perhaps ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] in the event of a separation or whatever .
[A] Right .
[B] So ,
[A] Well , I think we 've done it .
[B] Well , I think we 're about done .
[B] Okay .
[A] Thank you very much .
[B] Uh , good-bye .
[A] It 's been interesting .
[B] You take care .
[A] Okay .
[B] Bye .
[A] Bye .
