[A] How do you usually keep up with current events ?
-----
[B] Normally I listen to C N N or HEADLINE NEWS about an , hour a day ,
[B] and then I supplement that with , uh , radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week ,
[A] Do you ,
[B] and a newspaper if I have time .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I do n't usually have time to read the newspaper everyday ,
[A] so I try to listen to the radio in the morning and , and try to catch one of the morning talk shows ,
[A] and then I usually end up flipping through C N N and HEADLINE NEWS during the evening .
[A] I always try to read the Sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the , the week 's hot events .
[A] So , I try to , I try to catch that , if nothing else .
[B] That 's true ,
[B] and , and how do you rate the , uh ,
[B] h- , are you pleased with the news coverage that you 're receiving ?
-----
[A] For , for local news I think we do real well where it 's ,
[A] we live in a kind of small town ,
[A] but I think we get excellent local coverage , um ,
[A] and I like the national news that we see ,
[A] we , we watch N B C
[A] and I think they do a real good job .
[A] So , I 'm , I 've been real pleased with the quality of the news we get ,
[A] how about you ?
[B] On the whole , I 'm pleased when I have an opportunity to hear just the facts .
[B] I would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves . Um , since I do n't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite .
[A] Right .
[B] Uh , I think I 'm fed up with trite .
[B] There seems to be more and more of it ,
[B] and I understand the void that , uh , comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations
[B] and a- ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] as expensive as they are to produce , they certainly do n't want any dead airspace .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] but I think there 's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us ,
-----
[A] and like you said , save the commentaries because I 'm going to listen to the , the news and draw my own opinions .
[A] I do n't really need their help to do that .
[B] I , wo- , I , we 're certainly in agreement there .
-----
[A] I do n't think radio is as bad to do that as T V is .
[B] Radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done .
[B] They 're , maybe they 're a little more efficient ,
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] or have more to do over that same time frame .
[A] Right .
[B] I do n't know which that answer is .
[B] Uh , I think the , my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like SIXTY MINUTES .
[B] Do you watch that ?
[A] I used to ,
-----
[A] but I do n't anymore , maybe once or twice a year .
[B] Well , I used to watch SIXTY MINUTES until they did two programs , uh , that I knew both the people and the inc- , incidences ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and I knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint ,
[A] Really ?
[B] that was , in my estimate , nowhere near truth but was much better for ratings .
[A] Yes .
[B] And it , ever since that time I just do n't watch . Uh ,
-----
[B] so , I guess we have the , the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Well , I had heard a couple of people , you know , that I had talked to about certain programs say that , you know , they had read other things besides what SIXTY MINUTES presented and that they did n't present it nearly the same way as the , you know , news articles or whatever they had , they had already been familiar with .
[A] So , I started questioning just how , how bias they really were ,
-----
[A] so .
[B] I do n't know di- , I do n't know how old you are ,
[B] but it seems to me like the last , uh , newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that I wanted to hear was Walter Cronkite .
[A] Huh .
[B] So , I do n't , I do n't know if you 're familiar with him or not .
[A] No ,
[A] not really , you know ,
-----
[A] in the last few years just his kind of informal segments I 've seen
[A] but I never got to see his actual nightly news .
[A] I liked ,
[A] I , I did grow up with David Brinkley . Uh ,
[B] Well , Brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold ,
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] of Cronkite
[B] and he did a , a pretty good job .
[B] THE HUNTLEY , BRINKLEY REPORT was quite excellent ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] we ,
[B] over the years .
[A] we used to watch , um , him and I guess , John Chancellor .
-----
[A] And I always liked David Brinkley
[A] and I- , and I used to enjoy John Chancellor 's style of reporting ,
[A] but on the nightly news , now , he goes into his commentary
[A] and that 's where I get , get into the problem with , with him .
[A] I frequently disagree with his commentaries ,
[A] so .
[B] Well , once they 've reported the facts , all they can offer is an opinion anymore .
[A] Right .
[A] What did you think of the news coverage of the war ?
[B] Well , I almost felt like it was too much .
-----
[B] Indeed , I found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day , one in the morning and one in the evening .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Uh , i- , I spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst ,
[A] Really ?
[B] and I do n't need their fill-ins , you know .
[A] Did that help you understand a lot what was going on your , your prior experience with the military did ,
-----
[B] Yes ,
[B] but I , I think it helps me everyday in trying to review wh- , the state that the world is in and try to guess where we 're going .
[A] I wondered if it would help you sometimes fill in the gaps or recognize discrepancies that other people , people like myself might not pick up on .
[B] Well , I , I think , uh , my background is probably what absolutely turned me off with SIXTY MINUTES .
-----
[A] Okay .
[A] What weekly , um , magazine do you look at ,
[A] is it ,
[B] I like U S NEWS and WORLD REPORT .
-----
[B] At one time or another I 've taken them all for a year .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I believe in giving anything a chance .
[A] Sure .
[B] Uh , but I keep coming back to that one ,
[B] so , I , that 's kind of my favorite .
[A] Does that give a pretty good overview of everything
[A] or like , does it give , um , I guess , little encapsulated reports and , and then a few big stories ?
-----
[B] It 's primarily , um , a few big stories and then lots of high-level reports .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Uh , here 's what went on in Asia over the past week ,
[B] and there 's maybe a page of that , little brief paragraphs , unless that was one of their , the focus of their main stories .
[A] That sounds good if you were short on time , you could get a summary real quick .
-----
[B] Uh , it too is one those MUMBLEx
[B] in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways ,
[B] and I do most of my reading in the bathroom .
[A] Right .
[B] Um , and it 's one of those that I can ei- , read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that I 'm going to spend in there .
[A] Right .
[B] And it just seems to fit nicely , so that I can get it read in about three days .
[A] Well , we 're working on a NEWSWEEK , uh ,
-----
[A] for the last couple of months we got , you know , an introductory subscription ,
[A] so , we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like GLAMOUR or SPORTS ILLUSTRATED .
[A] So , we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us , so to speak .
[B] Well , to broaden your horizons , make you think about different things anyway .
[A] It ca n't hurt , .
-----
[B] Well , anytime that we stop and think it ca n't hurt .
[A] No .
[A] I , I even , I enjoy reading T NEWS ,
[A] I try to catch it because it 's another example ,
-----
[A] they just , they just show you the words and the facts
[A] and they , they do n't offer any commentary ,
[A] and it gives me a quick chance to , to be caught up during the day . Because , you know , we do n't listen to the radio at work at all .
[A] So , I do n't like to go the whole day without hearing anything .
[B] Oh , I 'm with you ,
-----
[B] I have to check T NEWS every , every day .
[B] It 's my noontime dose of facts .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] and the other thing we have that I like to check sometimes is , um , TALKING FINGERS ,
[A] do you have that ?
[B] No .
[A] You have different telephone numbers that you can dial ,
-----
[A] and then you dial in an access code
[A] and it will , depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update , it will give you , um , updated information .
[A] So , that can give you , you know , current news updates , current weather updates , things like that
[A] and it 's , it 's offered through the local phone company free of charge .
[A] So , that 's ,
[B] Huh .
[A] an interesting alternative occasionally that I like to use .
[B] Well , it does sound very interesting ,
[A] It ,
[B] maybe our phone company out here will get around to ,
-----
[A] It really is ,
[B] offering something like that .
[A] yeah , it really is nice , I mean , because it gives you a wide variety of things you can call and talk , and find out about .
[A] So , that is something you might keep your eyes open for ,
-----
[A] I think it 's , it 's catching on throughout the country .
