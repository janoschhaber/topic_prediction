[A] Okay ,
[A] so we 've got to talk about music .
[B] Okay .
[A] And , um , do you like classic rock , or modern rock , or which kind ?
[A] No ,
[A] not a seventies baby .
[B] Well , no that 's really when I grew up ,
[B] so that 's really what I like better ,
[B] is that kind of music ,
[B] I mean ,
[A] Is it disco ,
[A] or is it like ,
[B] No ,
[B] no ,
[B] no ,
[B] not that kind of music .
[A] but ,
[B] No ,
[B] more like , uh , rock , um , you know , like Led Zepplin type .
[A] Oh , okay .
[A] So , so they can get like the Doors and Led Zepplin .
[B] Right .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's cool .
[B] Right .
-----
[A] And , how about the Rolling Stones ?
[B] Oh , sure ,
[B] sure
[B] I went to their concert last year when they were here .
[A] Oh , that 's when , that 's when they took , toured .
[A] How about , um , Pink Floyd ?
[B] Sure ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] I like them .
[A] Okay .
[A] So , so then we got , we got some same things
[A] because ,
[B] Okay ,
[B] well , I just did n't know that much about music
[B] and I was n't sure what kind of music .
[A] No ,
[A] it 's very hard
[A] because , see , well , I mean , in the whole spectrum I 'd rather listen , you know ,
[A] I listen to heavy metal or classic rock .
[B] What , what kind of heavy metal are we talking about ?
[B] What ,
[A] We 're talking about what they , what they call hard rock .
[B] Okay ,
[B] like , give me some examples .
[A] Like , for example , let 's see , uh , Bad Company ,
[A] what ,
[B] Oh , well , Bad Cam- , Company 's not bad ,
[B] that 's not ,
[A] well , they 're like , for example , A C D C .
[B] Yeah ,
-----
[B] A C D C .
[A] Why ,
[A] have you heard of them ?
[B] Yes .
[A] Okay .
[A] And , stuff like that .
[A] That 's , that 's ,
[B] Well , okay .
[A] that 's not really hard rock .
[B] Okay ,
[B] I guess I did n't really consider that heavy metal .
[A] Okay .
[B] I mean , I , I think , when you say heavy metal , I 'm , I 'm thinking about like Cinderella , you know .
[A] Well , Cinderella is , is hard rock , heavy metal .
[B] Well , see , I do n't really care for Cinderella .
[B] But , I like A C D C 's okay .
[A] But , see , for example , they have , see what ,
-----
[A] but other bands consider it like really hard rock .
[A] It 's like brash metal , which all they do is like , they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar ,
[A] and the guitar is set like , really low ,
[B] Yeah .
[B] No ,
[B] I do n't really care for that too much , I guess .
[A] and , what happens is like , oh , everybody gets like totally into the music
[A] and then they start dancing around ,
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] and they just bump into each other ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] like , like they hit each other with their shoulders ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and , then , you knock people down ,
[A] and what you do is , you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people .
[B] Is that the kind of music that you like ?
-----
[A] No ,
[A] I do n't like that music .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] But , that 's , that 's what they do .
[A] That 's , that 's what some people call like really heavy metal .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] And , see , the difference , I guess , between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also .
[A] Like really , like heavy metal , wo- , is considered , like the words heavy metal
[A] and , like , you always thought about , like , suicide . And killing people and stuff like that .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And , just hard rock has ,
[A] they , they do n't talk about that ,
[A] they just talk about , like , life in general .
[B] Right .
[A] Like , Queen 's Reich , if you ever heard of them .
[B] Oh , sure .
[B] Of course .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Que- , you , you 're talking Queen ,
-----
[B] is that what you said ?
[A] Okay ,
[A] well , no .
[A] I said Queen 's Reich ,
[A] but ,
[B] Oh , oh , oh , okay ,
[A] but , oh , but you got to like Queen also .
[B] Right .
[A] So because ,
[B] Well sure ,
-----
[B] because Queen was real popular when I was growing up .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] especially , uh , oh God , what is it , A Night At The Opera ?
[A] Do n't they have a ,
[A] no
[A] let 's see , the one that they have the , the whole opera singing in the background .
[B] Oh !
[A] Bo , Bo , Bohemian Rhapsody .
[B] Right ,
[B] right ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that , that was great .
[A] I heard that the other day on the radio
[A] and I pumped it up .
[A] Because , I mean , I just love that song .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that , that was a real good one .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] but they had ,
[A] that , that whole record was pretty good .
[A] But then , they started going downhill like everybody else .
[B] Well , that 's true .
[B] They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] they 're , they 're still around ,
[A] they 've got a ne , new C D out ,
[A] but I , I would n't buy it .
[A] Because see , what happens is , the old , see whe- ,
[A] I like , I like the old Rolling Stones .
[A] I do n't like the new stuff .
[B] Of the Stones ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I agree .
[B] That 's the ne- ,
[B] the older stuff is the best of it .
[B] The , the new stuff 's kind of more like , today 's rock and roll , which I ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] do n't really care for today 's rock and roll too much .
[A] Well , for example , I used to like old Phil Collins .
[B] Right .
[B] Yes ,
[B] definitely .
[B] I agree .
[A] And , and , then what happened was that Phil Collins said , hey I can make money , a lot of money doing this ,
[A] and then he came out with , uh , see , for example , his , his record like , No Jacket Required .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] That was good ,
[A] but it was on his way of going downhill ,
[A] because he said , I can make a lot of money just singing alone ,
[A] and then he came out with the Invisible Touch , with , uh , Genesis
[A] and that really ,
[A] like now , I hate Phil Collins ,
[A] I ca n't stand him .
[B] Right .
[A] Because , I look at him
[A] and I say , you know , you were singing at this time , and with these people ,
[A] and you were great ,
[A] and now you 're singing all this stuff that , does n't matter what you , what you sing or what you record ,
[A] it 's still going to be a number one hit .
[A] And so , that 's , that 's what gets me mad .
[B] Yeah .
[A] But , did , did you go see that new Doors movie ?
[B] No ,
[B] not yet .
[B] I guess I 've been , con , kind of considering it .
[B] Have you seen it yet ?
[A] Yeah .
[A] I saw it when it opened .
[B] Was it really good ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] you know , like those guys that criticize movies ?
[B] Right .
[A] And , they both loved the movie , right ?
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] They said the music 's great ,
[A] it took me back to the sixties , and stuff like that .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And then , one of them said , well , everything is great ,
[A] but I 'm going to give it thumbs down .
[A] And they go ,
[A] but why ?
[A] Because it 's like , the end is , like , really depressing .
[A] And so ,
[B] Oh .
[A] But it , but it 's like the movie is so well made ,
[A] and the music that goes with it just picks you up , see ,
[A] I was never , I was born in nineteen hundred sixty-nine .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] So , I mean , so for me ,
[B] So , you did n't really grow up with that kind of music then .
[A] No ,
[A] but you learn to .
[A] I mean it 's just that , like the , the sixties music 's got a lot to say .
[B] Right .
[A] I , I never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too .
[A] You know , I was like ,
[B] Well no ,
[B] I 've never liked disco .
[A] Hey ,
[A] but I bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants ,
[B] Well , that 's true .
[B] That 's true .
[B] But , I was more in the late seven- ,
[B] well , I shou ,
[B] like mid to late seventies , like between seventy-five and ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[B] and , seventy-nine , was more my era .
[A] Did , did you go to college ?
[B] Well , no .
[B] I 'm going right now .
[A] Oh , that 's cool .
[B] But uh , no
[B] I did n't go then .
[B] But see , I graduated high school in seventy-eight ,
[A] Okay .
[B] so , you know , in seventy-eight , you know rock was starting to get really heavy , you know ,
[B] and real , um ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[B] I do n't know ,
[B] disco was pretty much dead by then .
[A] Yeah .
[B] So , so that 's what I mean ,
[B] disco was n't really my time .
[A] Well , they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in , in progression , ever in history .
[A] So ,
[B] About music ?
[A] No ,
[A] about everything .
[B] Oh . Okay .
[A] So , it 's like , nothing happened during the seventies .
[A] Everything happened during the sixties ,
[A] the seventies I do n't know what they 're called , you know ,
[A] it 's like , like
[A] the , the eighties are called , like the progressive years , or the , or , you know , like the technology years ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] because of all the computers and stuff .
[A] But the seventies got nothing .
[A] I mean , nobody cared to name it .
[B] That 's kind of funny .
[A] So .
[B] You 're right .
[B] I never thought of that .
[B] The disco years , that 's what they 're calling them ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I know .
[B] are gone .
[A] Can you imagine the , like a big picture of John Travolta , ta-da , what is it SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER ?
[A] Him just standing there .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] right .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's a good example to look for in history .
[A] Well , from now on we 're going to go from the , from nineteen sixty-nine when they took the first step on the moon , to nineteen eighties .
[A] Okay ,
[A] what happened in the middle ?
[A] Do n't worry ,
[A] do n't worry ,
[A] you 're not , you 're not missing anything , you know ,
[A] so ,
[B] That 's true .
[B] Well , except for Vietnam .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] really .
[A] And , that 's ,
[B] You know with ,
[A] that 's why I guess , everybody ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] it 's like they do n't want to talk about that ,
[A] so they just , do n't name it .
[A] I mean , it was , it was , I guess it was pretty bad times .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Well , that 's very true .
[B] But ,
[A] Oh , well , let 's see ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] okay ,
[A] we 've been talking for seven minutes ,
[A] so ,
[B] Oh , good .
[B] I have n't even been keeping track .
[A] Okay ,
[A] all right ,
[A] so um , I 'm going to leave you alone .
[A] Uh what , what are you doing ?
[A] Do you have a family ?
[B] Uh , yeah .
[A] Okay .
[B] We 're kind of , I was kind of in the middle of supper ,
[B] but it 's not a big deal ,
[A] Oh , I 'm sorry .
[B] I just left it .
[B] No ,
[B] it 's okay ,
[B] because see I did n't , see
[B] somebody tried to call me last night
[B] but I did n't have my number yet ,
[B] I just got it today .
[A] Oh , okay .
[B] And so , you know , it 's okay .
[B] I , I told them I 'd be available during this time ,
[B] so ,
[A] Okay .
[A] All right .
[B] anyway .
[A] So then , uh , have fun doing this .
