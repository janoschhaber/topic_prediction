[A] All right ,
[A] well I have a lot of different teams that I like to , to keep in touch with ,
[A] of course , Texas Rangers being one of them ,
[A] I mean , uh , you know , you ca n't live in Dallas without , you know ,
[B] Well what are the others ?
[A] Well , uh , I originally came from Saint Louis ,
[A] so , uh , the Saint Louis Cardinals are one , uh ,
[A] I moved to Kansas City ,
[A] see I have , I have a tendency to , a , adopt teams when I wen , go to a tea- , uh , go to a town .
[B] Well it 's helpful .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] so , uh , I lived in Kansas City for a couple years
[A] and I adopted the Royals ,
[A] I lived in Houston for two and a half years
[A] so I adopted the , uh , uh , the Houston Astros ,
[A] so I mean , you know , I 've got quite a few .
[B] Well do you keep up with the statistical stuff ?
[A] No ,
[A] I do n't , I do n't get into that too much ,
[A] eve- , every once in a while , I will keep in , in touch , with maybe , like who 's in the top five of hitting , or something like that
[A] but I do n't get into , you know , how many errors somebody has or things like that .
[B] Well there 's , there 's a guy on , that was on MUMBLEx show that I listen to going to work in the morning --
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- who does , uh , uh ,
[B] it 's essentially trivial statistics --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- but they 've got a st- ,
[B] it 's a statistic that has to do with winning and losing one run games .
[A] I 've heard of that one .
[B] And apparently the Rangers last year , won a lot of one run games .
[A] Well I did n't know that ,
-----
[A] that 's supposed to be a real good statistic , uh .
[B] Well , it , it , it is
[B] but it 's the , it 's , it 's a reverse indicator .
[A] Well that 's true ,
[A] they do n't have the offense to , uh , to get out , or to have the , the more runs ,
[A] so .
[B] Well what the , what the argument is
-----
[B] and it , it , it , it 's one of these statistical ,
[B] gee , how can you draw a conclusion from it ,
[B] but they find that , tha- , tha- , there 's a connection between that and how they do in Spring training the following year .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , uh , it 's strangely enough , it 's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year .
[A] Huh .
[B] Which means that if you have a good year winning one ru- , one run games that the following year , you 'll have a bad year .
[B] And they , they 've got , um , they 've looked at I think twenty-three teams , uh ,
[B] and , and , the , uh , statistics are something like twenty-one out of twenty-three .
[B] It was ,
[B] which means the Rangers are going to have a terrible year ,
[B] I , uh ,
[A] Which I was kind of leaning toward anyway , to tell you the truth .
-----
[B] Well , I mean , and it 's , uh , uh ,
[B] I do n't know ,
[B] what do you , what do you think of Incaviglia 's loss .
[A] I kind of think it was necessary ,
-----
[A] I mean , I , i- , i- , I do n't , I 'm not a , a big , um , pure power hitter anyway .
[A] I mean , I do n't like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time .
[A] I mean , uh , I think that , uh , that a player ought to hit a home run if he 's got the pitch to do it ,
[A] but when you get two strikes on you , you have a tend- , you know , you should , you know , shorten your swing a little bit , you know ,
[A] if it 's a perfect shot , go for it ,
[A] but I mean , you know , the strike outs were a big problem for him ,
[A] and , uh , plus supposedly what I heard , he was not much of a team player anyway ,
[A] so .
[B] Well it , it 's an interesting concept , though , when you look at , uh , of , of how baseball , how apparently ,
-----
[B] I was reading in the paper tonight that the Detroit Tigers are going to sign him .
[B] And , uh , and the point of , of , I guess ,
[B] I do n't understand the , the strategy of how baseball works ,
[B] but it seems that , you know , they can sign him tomorrow ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and he could go in the team the next day ,
[B] and , and , and they put him in the lineup
[B] and he hits a home run
[B] and all of a sudden he becomes a hero .
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] well that 's true .
[B] And , and all he has to do is hit the ball ,
[B] I mean , you 're not , a- ,
[B] and all he has to do is one , you know , hit it once .
[B] It does n't ,
[B] he can , he can stri , he can swing a couple times , MUMBLEx
[B] if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can .
[A] Right .
-----
[B] It 's an interesting , uh , an interesting concept of , of how they do it .
[B] But I agree with you
[B] I think that , I think that 's part of what , uh , baseball needs more of .
[B] I , uh , I , I guess what bothers me is , is that when you go , um , you wait and wait and wait
[B] and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run
[B] and that 's all the game is .
[B] I 'd rather see the ball hit around and have the people ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well there 's , there 's another point to that too .
[A] They said the , that um , that he was horrible at , uh , at batting with , with men on base .
[A] Now having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you , you know , gives you run , obviously .
[B] Yes .
-----
[A] But I mean if you ca n't do it with men on base , there 's something definitely wrong , um , you know ,
[A] you , you 've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs , you know , to , to be able to , uh , score enough runs to be able to win in these , uh , in this day and age ,
[A] so .
[B] Yeah ,
-----
[B] well how do you think the Royals are going to do ?
[A] I think the Royals will do okay .
[A] They have , they have several pitchers that had badly years last year
[A] and they are , they 're these , uh , cycle pitchers ,
[A] they , they pitch one year bad , one year good , one beer bad , one year good .
[A] Saberhagen has won , uh , supposedly the Cy ,
[A] I think he won Cy year , uh , two out of three years ,
[A] and , uh , you know , so he 's very much due for a good year .
[B] Well are they going to beat , are they going to beat Oakland ?
-----
[A] Well now see that 's a good question ,
[A] I , that 's , I do n't know how Oakland 's going to react to being , uh , swept in the World Series last year .
[A] They could very easily , uh , take that as a challenge . Which is the way most teams nat- , you know , naturally do .
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] Uh , and , and , just go out and not give anybody a chance to beat them ,
[A] so ,
[B] Well I go to Saint Louis from time to time
[B] and I watch , I , I watch their sports up there
[B] and they 're ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] uh , they 're certainly intense about the Cardinals they ,
[A] Oh yeah ,
[A] baseball is their , is their life up there like football is down here I think .
[B] Y- , did you actually live in Saint Louis ?
[A] I lived in the suburbs of Saint Louis ,
[A] yeah .
[B] Ye- , everybody does , right .
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] that 's true too , .
[A] I think that 's all that they have .
[B] I had a friend from college that lives in , uh ,
[B] MUMBLEx it 's well , I should say on the west side ,
[B] I mean everything 's on the west side .
[B] Manchester ?
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] Uh , out that way ,
[A] Um .
[B] and I went and visited him ,
[B] but anyway , it is interesting .
[B] Well how are the Cardinals ?
[B] Do you still keep up with them , or someth- ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] oh yeah ,
[A] I , I definitely do ,
[A] in fact I 've got family that still lives up there .
[A] Um , from what I hear from everybody up there , they 're not going to have a good year because they let too many people go .
[A] But I 've been following Spring training
[A] and they 're like one of the best teams in spring training so far .
[B] Well is that a good indicator ?
-----
[A] That , well it can be .
[A] It , it really kind of depends on , on , um , what they were , you know , what they were looking for .
[A] In other words , if , if in Spring cra- , training they were looking at all their kids , like a lot of them do , um , then it really does n't give you any indication .
[A] But if they were , uh , playing the people that they 're going to play , then that might be pretty good indication ,
[A] so , you know , it 's , it 's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just , you know , come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring crani- , training and then gone on a , you know , fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season
[A] so ,
[B] You know what I think is remarkable is , uh ,
-----
[B] it seems that what you really need to do to win though , is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have , have , have real breakthrough years .
[A] Exactly ,
[A] yeah .
[B] And , and the question is how do you forecast that ,
[A] You ca n't .
[B] if you had to , if you had to bet on who would be in the World Series , I mean it would be really tough .
[A] Right ,
[A] th- , I think the best thing that you can do is go with , um , the players that are , that have the talent to do the best years . And , um , that they had n't had these , uh , gigantic , uh , career years yet and ,
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] and just kind of assume that , you know , so- , one of them is going to break through eventually ,
[A] so . And I , I think they said the Reds , um ,
[A] this last year , I 'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years .
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] You know , and , and so they may be even be , better this year .
[B] Well , well when are the Rangers going to come through th- ,
[A] Uh , that 's a good question .
[A] I ,
[A] the Rangers have a , have a pitching problem
[A] and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question .
[A] They 're doing the right thing , though , uh ,
[A] they are going with their farm system .
[A] They 're letting their farm system , uh , build up and stuff like that
[A] and ,
[B] Well is there enough money ,
[B] that 's part of it ,
[B] I , uh ,
[B] that was part of Skip Bayless ' argument .
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] I do n't know if you read Skip Bayless , but --
[A] No .
[B] -- a , a local commentary
[B] and ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] his argument is that uh , the ownership is not inclined to lose big money long enough to , to bring in the big dollars .
[A] Um , that 's probably true .
-----
[B] Would you , would you agree with that ?
[A] Well considering what I 've seen in the last , uh , you know , two seasons , I 'm beginning to agree with that ,
[A] yeah .
[A] But I mean , you do n't have to spend the big money , as far as I 'm concerned to , uh , to win .
[A] You just have to spend it if it 's necessary .
[B] Uh .
[A] In other words if you 've got a player on your team who 's helping your team , then keep him there .
[A] Do n't let him go away .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And I think that 's really what 's been hurting , uh , the , uh , Rangers .
[B] Well did n't Kansas City put up quite a bit of money for their --
[A] Oh yeah ,
[A] they , they spent more money ,
[B] -- pitching staff .
[A] last year than any other team in the , in the league
[A] and they were , you know , toward the bottom of the league .
[A] Uh , so it 's like I said spending money does n't guarantee you , uh , winning a pennant .
[B] Yeah .
[A] It really does n't ,
[A] so .
[B] Well and that , I think that 's maybe part of it that , that the , um ,
[B] and it , you know ,
[B] if I owned the team . I think you 'd like them to do well
[B] but the question of losing big , big money that what , did , did , did Steinbrenner actually make money on the ,
[A] Uh , you got me .
[A] I , you know , I think that there 's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan ca n't go
[A] and once you do that , you lose everything ,
[A] I mean .
[B] Well it 's , it , it , yeah , it 's a little bit like any other sport , you know .
[B] When it starts costing you fifty or a hundred dollars to go to a game --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and , uh , you know , I mean , I , I guess as we get older , i- , you 're probably going ,
[B] if , if you , if you compare to go to a , a sport , a , a
[B] say you go to a rock concert ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] or , or even a performance , a , an opera or the symphony or something , uh ,
[B] if , you know , i- ,
[B] but how , how often do you do that .
[A] Right .
[B] An
[B] I , I , I would , I would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there , you know , several times a ,
[A] That , that 's the whole point .
[A] There are so many games in , in a year that they 've got to have repeat customers .
[B] Yeah .
[A] They ca n't afford not to ,
[A] and , you know , that 's one of the things that I think Saint Louis has done , um ,
[A] I mean ,
[A] their , you know , their ticket prices are , you know , kin- , I guess as high as anybody else 's
[A] but what , somehow or another they , attract , uh , so many people from , som- ,
[A] I mean they 're a , it 's a small market
[A] and yet they attract as many if not more than most , uh , uh , most , other cities ,
[A] so .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] but do n't you think there 's a , there , there are older fans there .
[B] I , I do n't mean older , um , you know ,
[B] the fact that , that it 's , it 's a better established and that the , the city is , is , is more , of a ...
