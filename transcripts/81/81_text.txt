[A] Well , I have n't heard anything about the proposal myself ,
[A] but , uh ,
[B] No ,
[B] I have n't either .
[A] Uh , I do n't know if it 's their proposal or one that 's being seriously kicked around .
[A] I 've , I 've always felt for a long time that I , I think that all young kids ought to do a stint , uh , primarily in the military .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Uh .
[B] Most countries require that now ,
[B] they --
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[B] -- you know , they have , uh , it mandatory for , for the , the uh --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- at least the young men ,
[B] I do n't know about the young women ,
[B] I do n't know if they have to serve in the military ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] a lot ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] well , you take Israel --
[B] too .
[A] -- I mean , everybody does .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I do n't think it 's a bad idea ,
[A] teaches , teaches a lot .
[A] I mean , I went in the service when I was eighteen ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , uh , stayed in for ten years .
[B] Is that right ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] uh , did a lot of growing up .
[B] I bet .
[A] 
[B] You have to .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] my father had been in the military .
[B] I did n't do it myself .
[B] My father had
[B] and that 's , uh , how he put himself through school basically .
[A] Yeah .
[B] He came from a poor immigrant family ,
[B] and he did n't have a chance to , uh , you know ,
[B] the family was n't wealthy ,
[B] so he had to do something to ,
[A] Do it himself .
[B] put himself through school ,
[B] and he did .
[B] And he was very successful .
[A] Well , my parents wanted to send me to college ,
[A] and I was dead set against it .
[B] 
[A] You know , I had wanderlust , you know .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And I got in ,
[A] and after , after wasting the first six years , partying and everything else , I decided , uh-huh , time to settle down and do something .
[A] So I started to work on my education .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Course my job was such that I did n't , I could n't do it as much as I wanted --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and still I ended up going two semesters when I got out just to get my degree .
[B] That 's pretty good .
[A] But , I 've been in school ever since .
[B] That 's good .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I guess .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's , uh ,
[B] I do n't know .
[B] There 's other kinds of service to the country that could be done , you know ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I mean if you do n't like ,
[B] I mean , working in the national parks ,
[A] Sure .
[B] Uh , working , clean up the roadsides --
[A] Exactly .
[B] -- I mean , I 've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time ,
[A] Oh yeah ,
[A] absol- ,
[B] not all the time because that takes away from their opportunity to look for a job , but at least some of their time to look for , to go out and clean up the roads .
[A] Absolutely .
[B] You know ,
[B] I mean ,
[A] All these , all this money that we 're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we 're paying all these welfare recipients ,
[A] and if they 're able-bodied people , I do n't see any problem at all with having them go out there and , and , if nothing else , get a group of them together and take them around to old folks --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- places and let them cut the yards , paint the houses .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] we 'd learn service to other people --
[A] Sure ,
[A] sure .
[B] -- in this country .
[A] So I 'm ,
[A] get something out of that money .
[B] Country would benefit ,
[A] Yeah
[A] I 've ,
[B] I mean , uh ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] my next door neighbor when I was growing up , worked for the unemployment division ,
[A] and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied
[A] and ,
[B] That right .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] and he , he had all kinds of horror stories .
[A] You know , these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks ,
[A] and , back , back in those days they also use to give you , uh , booklets good for , uh , clothing and gas , and things like this .
[B] Yeah .
[A] They get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- you know ,
[A] and I 'm , I jus- , I have a hard time dealing with that .
[B] What I hear one time , I think it was on Paul Harvey 's , uh , radio segment , that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy , each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I mean , I was astounded .
[B] I do n't even make that .
[A] No ,
[A] I know .
[A] I , you , you think about , you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] and somebody 's taking that away .
[A] and , and there 's probably , there 's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] no doubt .
[A] You know , it 's , it 's , it 's totally ridiculous ,
[A] and now , I , I , I , uh , started out when I first got in graduate school
[A] I was going into public administration ,
[A] and , uh , quite honestly I just got so fed up with it I just could n't stand it any more .
[B] Is that right ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I mean , this is the kind of thing you look at .
[B] Yeah .
[A] You sit there
[A] and when you 're writing up budgets , you wonder , okay , how much money do we need .
[A] Well , you need X number dollars for the recipients
[A] but you need X number dollars to administer the program .
[A] Well just ridiculous .
[B] Yeah .
[A] This is ridiculous .
[B] It 's sad .
[A] It is ,
[A] it 's pathetic .
[A] I mean , there 's got to be a different way .
[A] There 's got to be a better way .
[A] But it 'll never happen .
[A] I mean , these --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- these people out here getting that money are big voting blocks .
[B] Yeah .
[B] What would happen if the MUMBLEx required young people to do service to the country ,
[B] what should they get in return , I wonder .
[B] Like , uh ,
[A] I think , I think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as , uh ,
[A] and I would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Give an incentive .
[B] Educational or vocational training or something .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Something that 's going to help them along the way .
[B] And they 'll help the country eventually , too ,
[A] Sure ,
[A] I mean ,
[B] because rather than having a bunch of uneducated people we can have educated people ,
[A] Well , this ,
[A] I mean --
[B] and that 's only going to help .
[A] -- I mean , look at the statistics ,
[A] I mean , it 's sad .
[A] One in five Americans ca n't read --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- adults , that is , ca n't even read .
[A] And , and we 've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I mean , what are we , what are we becoming ?
[A] We 're becoming a service country .
[B] As opposed to what we were twenty years ago .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] we were an industrial giant ,
[A] and now we 're no- , we 're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game .
[A] We taught them how to do it ,
[A] and they , they did it better than we do .
[B] Yeah
[A] Simple as that .
[B] because they have the ambition , I guess .
[A] yeah ,
[A] simple as that .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] which is good for them ,
[B] but on the other hand , we kind of lose out .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it 's terrible for us .
[B] I think that if , uh , young people had service to the country might give them more ambition .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Because they learn that serving other people is a good thing .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] and , and it can be good for them , too .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] oh yeah .
[A] I mean , even , even the greedy kids that we 've got now ...
[B] Oh god , you go to the mall
[B] and you see , you know , fourteen year old kids flaunting money , because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night , you know --
[A] I know .
[B] -- for what .
[A] I know .
[B] Give me the money
[B] and I 'll , I 'll teach them something good .
[A] Well , you know , you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] uh , that 's my other complaint .
[A] Parents are n't parents any more .
[B] No .
[B] They 've , they 've relinquished their parenting .
[A] Yeah .
[A] One of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble ?
[B] Yeah .
[A] Well , as a substitute teacher for a year , I , I can say yes .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I mean , I talked with somebody else about that another time ,
[B] and , you know , when I 's in graduate school working on my master 's degree in math , I was , uh , teaching as part of my , part of the program .
[B] And I just love teaching .
[B] That was a lot , that 's probably the most fun I had .
[B] And , uh , it helped me out because I learned --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- things and learned how to do things differently .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And when , uh , when come time to get out of school , I thought , Boy , I 'd like to teach .
[B] But you know , for , for what .
[A] Yeah .
[B] You know , I do n't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life .
[A] Exactly .
[B] I mean , that , that 's a sad thing to think ,
[B] and that 's kind of selfish on my part ,
[B] and I admit that ,
[A] Well , in a way it is ,
[A] but you have to look out for yourself --
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's right .
[A] -- you know ,
[A] I mean , that 's some- ,
[A] and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers ,
[B] That 's wrong .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] gosh ,
[A] I mean ,
[B] I 'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less ,
[B] I saying teachers should be paid more .
[A] No ,
[A] I mean yeah .
[A] They do an absolutely necessary job ,
[A] I mean , I , I have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that .
[B] Yeah .
[A] But , uh , I mean , there 's , there 's a sense of priorities here , too .
[B] Yeah .
[A] You know , we need ,
[A] what 's more important , picking up the garbage or educating our kids .
[B] Yeah
[B] . They both have their place .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] they , they ,
[A] sure .
[B] But , you know , when it gets right down to it ,
[A] I mean , one 's import ,
[A] I mean , on the other hand , I mean , you take a garbage man in New York City starts out at twenty-six thousand dollars .
[B] That 's pretty good .
[A] Well I bet you there 's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I mean , my other pet peeve is unions .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] oh yeah .
[A] You know , it 's just , it 's , it 's ridiculous the way unions have gone .
[A] There was a time when unions were needed .
[B] And they served a good function .
[A] And they served a good function ,
[A] but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated ,
[A] and they 're only there to perpetuate their own , their own power structure .
[B] I remember , the company my dad worked for , the people there went on strike against the management .
[B] It was a steel manufacturing place ,
[B] and they , uh ,
[B] this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap ,
[B] and they were having a hard time .
[B] And they told the strikers there , look ,
[B] we need you to come back and get this stuff done .
[B] Or else we 're going to be out of business .
[B] And they would n't come back ,
[B] so they went bankrupt .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And , and they all lost their jobs .
[A] Sure ,
[A] and , and --
[B] And it 's like , you know .
[A] -- and that 's really what happened to the steel industry in this country .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So many times , I mean , you had the , uh , the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time .
[A] And , well , that took care of that industry --
[B] That 's right .
[A] -- and , and , then , and I 'll tell you ,
[A] Detroit worked awfully hard on , on stopping car manufacturing in this country .
[B] And they 're trying to do that now with the imports .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I mean , you know , we 've never caught up ,
[A] and I do n't think we ever will .
[B] It 'll be a tough road , though .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I mean , here it is ,
[A] and we 've got , we 've got to go into partnership with the Japanese to build cars .
[B] Yeah .
[A] You know . And they only did it because they , I guess they were embarrassed --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- that they 're so good at it .
[B] That 's about right .
[A] Gosh .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well , back to the original subject ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] I think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service ,
[A] I do n't care what kind it is .
[B] It teaches them pride in their country .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] and pride in themselves , too .
[B] That 's right .
[A] They could , they could , I mean , you could organize something just within your community .
[B] Yeah ,
[A] same old thing .
[A] I mean ,
[B] that 's right .
[B] That 's like Eagle Scouts .
[A] Sure .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And that 's a great idea .
[A] I think they ought to take them and , I do n't know , just have sort of like a , a , a manpower pool and say Okay , look ,
[A] we need somebody ...
