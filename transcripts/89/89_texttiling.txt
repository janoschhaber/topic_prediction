[A] Okay .
[B] Okay ,
[B] that made a nice ugly sound .
[B] So ,
[A] Your name is Lynn ?
[B] Linda .
[A] Linda .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] So , sounds like you like to read .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I read quite a bit , probably do n't read as much as I would like to .
[B] I do n't read as much as I would like to either .
[B] I 'm , I 'm a single mom ,
[B] but I have always loved reading .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] What do you like to read ?
[A] Um , well um , I 'm a , I 'm a counselor , a therapist by trade ,
[A] so most of my books are , um , I guess what you 'd call self improvement type of books .
[B] That what I 've been reading lately a lot of .
-----
[B] Um , my interests switch around dramatically .
[B] I used to read just , mainly fic- , fiction ,
[B] and now I , lik- , like a said , I 've read a lot of self , self help books .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] What kind of things have you read ?
[B] Oh , I read all kinds of things for , um , helping people survive a divorce .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Uh , THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED was probably one of my favorites .
[B] Have you read that ?
[A] Uh , I have n't gotten through it yet .
[B] You have n't ?
[A] No .
[B] Okay ,
[B] what would you recommend ?
[A] Um , as far as dealing with divorce ?
[B] Oh , I 'm kind of getting that one past me , but a good self help book .
[A] Good self help .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Well , um probably the best one that I , I know of and I work with all the time is called SEARCH FOR SIGNIFICANCE --
[B] Um , that sounds good .
-----
[A] -- by Robert McGee --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and it 's one that we use in our work .
[A] It 's probably one you 'd find in like a Christian book store .
[A] I do n't know what the chains are down there . Maybe in the mall family book store , something like that .
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] I 'm writing it down .
[B] That does soun , that 's sound really good .
[B] Um , what kind of counseling do you do ,
[B] or should we stay on the topic of books ?
[A] Um , probably should stay on the topic ,
[A] but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that I read .
[B] MUMBLEx .
[A] I 'm a therapist for Rossa .
[A] It 's a Christian treatment organization --
[B] Oh .
[A] -- and because of that I see , uh , work with adolescents specifically ,
[A] so I see a lot of kids with , with various problems .
[A] Right now some of the things I 'm working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse ,
[A] so a lot of the books I 've been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues .
[B] Oh , I would imagine helping them feel good about themselves
-----
[B] they 're at a bad stage anyway ,
[B] and then to have to deal with sexual abuse --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- would be terrible , as a teen .
[B] That 's , uh , MUMBLEx that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that .
[A] Well , sometimes it 's rewarding ,
[A] and , and sometimes it 's a struggle .
[B] Oh , I 'm sure ,
[B] I 'm sure .
[B] Uh , what oth ,
[B] is , is that just the only type of reading you 've been doing ,
[B] or do you , have you read any good novels lately ?
[A] Um , I guess I 've got so many books like that that I need to read
[A] it 's , it 's hard for me to do a lot of , uh ,
[B] just joy reading .
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] reading , yeah , reading just for enjoyment .
[B] I hear you there ,
[B] that 's for sure . Um ,
[A] In fact ,
[B] I guess , the last book I 've read ,
[B] my oldest daughter had to read LOST HORIZONS for her English class ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And I just realized I had never read it growing up .
[B] So , I just finished reading that for enjoyment .
[A] Um , that 's neat .
-----
[B] And it wa , it was good .
[B] Um , she , she 's not , did n't enjoy it much ,
[B] so I did n't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her .
[B] But I thought it was real interesting .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I 've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- um , because I enjoyed some of those stories so much ,
[A] but I never seem to have the time to do --
[B] I know .
-----
[A] -- that kind of reading .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Um , I trying to think of some of my other favorite books ,
[B] but , I , I keep lists ,
[B] I must have a list of , oh , two hundred , three hundred books that I want to read .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Just like , MUMBLEx I want to read that and I write it down .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I 've got a stack next to my bed .
[B] So do I .
-----
[A] I tend to get a little bit of ways in a book
[A] and then I , I get distracted , and , or have to start on another one ,
[A] it 's pretty tough to keep up with .
[A] I was trying to think of ,
[A] I , I 've got a copy of THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED
[A] but I was trying to think , there 's another Scott MUMBLEx book that I 've got that I had read .
[B] Uh , He , he also wrote PEOPLE OF THE LIE .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's the one I was thinking of .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I , I bought that one ,
[B] and I did n't get into , involved in that one as well .
[B] There 's another one he wrote that even sounds better ,
[B] and it 's kind of the whole concept of global peace , you know , like , and communities --
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] -- building communities .
[B] Someone just recently said something really neat about that .
[B] Uh , I got involved in , uh , Beginning Experience Weekends ,
[B] and , uh , it was of the people from there that said that .
[B] His latest book , and I ca n't recall the name of it , is just excellent ,
[B] and his whole idea is , we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects .
[B] And he did , uh , mention Beginning Experience Weekends as one of the , you know , one of the places .
[A] Uh .
[B] So , I 've ha- , um ,
[A] That 's interesting .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it , it really was .
[B] A real fun boo- , bunch of books that I read , uh , the beginning of last year were , um , the author of JONATHAN , JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEA- , SEAGULL --
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] -- I ca n't think of his name .
[A] Is it MUMBLEx ?
[B] Pardon me --
[A] MUMBLEx ?
[B] -- uh , no , uh , oh ,
[B] it 'll , it 'll come to me ,
[B] but he wrote , he wrote the ILLUSION , and A BRIDGE OVER TI- , A BRIDGE TO FOREVER .
[B] Those are MUMBLEx mind expanding books .
[A] Um .
[B] His concepts are so different than what I would have ever dreamed of .
[B] I ca n't think of what his name is right , right off the bat , though .
[B] But , uh , they , they were fun .
[B] They were real just books for fun .
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] Have you been involved on the Switchboard long ?
[A] Um , not very long .
[A] I really just started .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] How did you get involved ?
[A] My wife has been working for T I .
[B] Oh , I see .
[B] I 'm a former T I-er .
[B] I just recently quit .
[B] And so , uh , I got myself involved in a sales job ,
[B] and right now , my list of books to be read have to do with , uh , the art of selling .
[A] Oh , uh-huh .
-----
[B] So .
[A] It 's just , I was just thinking , at , at Rossa
[A] they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- just to help us deal with all the things that we have to deal with .
[A] So , I keep getting stacks of books I need to read ,
[A] and ,
[B] Never ,
[B] never --
[A] I do n't know when I 'm going to get to them all .
[B] -- there 's never going to be enough hours in the day .
[A] I do n't think so .
[B] Even if you took speed reading . Huh .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I do n't think so .
[B] So , well , I 'm trying to think of what other kind .
[B] Do you like to read mysteries .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] a little bit .
[B] Do you like Ken MUMBLEx ?
[A] Um . Trying to think .
[B] He writes , uh , spy novels , THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and , uh , I 've , I 've really , I really have found his books enjoyable .
[A] I like that kind of stuff .
[A] I think the last novel I read I read , I guess , in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year .
[A] It was a , um , last name 's MUMBLEx ,
[A] it 's called PIERCING , no , it 's called THIS PRESENT DARKNESS .
[B] Um .
[A] It 's , uh , kind of unusual book .
[A] It 's a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that .
[B] Oh that sounds interesting .
[B] It sounds really good .
[B] Hey , you should make yourself a promise that you 'll , you 'll read one novel in the next six months , just for you .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] You know , it 's , it 's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work , or , you know , self improvement ,
[B] and you kind of forget the fun of reading .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's true .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] very easily .
[B] So ,
[A] Well , I guess we 've covered the topic pretty thoroughly .
[B] I think so , too .
[B] And I thank you for calling .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] nice talking to you , Linda .
[B] And , uh , I 'll have to check out that book you ,
[A] Okay ,
[A] great .
[B] told me about .
[B] Okay ,
[A] Hope you like you it .
[B] Thank you .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] You take care .
[A] You , too .
[B] Bye-bye .
[A] Bye-bye .
