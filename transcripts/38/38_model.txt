[A] Well , what is your view , do you consider the Soviet Union a threat ?
-----
[B] I do n't know that it 's so much a military threat anymore as a ,
[B] , well , you know , it 's , it 's real confusing right now to know what kind of a , of , of a threat it is , I guess ,
[A] Sure .
[B] it , it takes awhile to , to get used to something ,
[B] you know , if , if they have completely chain- ,
[B] on the , place has completely turned that much around to where they 're not , you know , not what they used to be ,
[A] Right .
[B] uh .
[A] It 's , it 's hard to , to know anymore if it 's a , a threat one way or another because , uh , it used to be s- , so , f- , much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell , you know , rank and file in behind it .
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And now that with Gorbachev is introducing more , I guess , freedoms or expressions of freedom , it does n't look as though , you know , everybody 's following the same pattern .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And , those ,
[A] the people who are , you know , the staunch military conservative people ,
[A] you never know , well , Gorbachev 's future is like whereas ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] whereas in the past it was seen as , you know , whoever was the head of the , the communist party was seen as , you know , untouchable .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I thi ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so , uh , dramatic that you almost think , now wait a minute , you know , we 're getting stuck into something here , you know ,
[B] if ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] if somebody 's about to , to clobber you , the first thing they do is sort of say , well , you know , we 're , we 're ashamed , we 're not going to do that anymore .
-----
[A] Exactly .
[B] And , uh , , um , you know , I 'd , I 'd like to think that that is n't true
[B] but I , I ,
[B] you know , the evidence is that , uh , you know , he 's , he 's let some , some stuff go , you know , the east German situation .
[A] Right .
[B] It 's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible ,
[B] you know , if I 'd have been asleep for five years ,
[B] and read it in a book , I said , no , no , no , that did n't , could n't have happened that way .
[A] Right .
[A] Well , it 's amazing just because of the drain that 's been on , you know , both economies that our economy is , of course , been able to , uh , withstand that a little better ,
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] but , uh , the Russian economy
[A] they , you know , they ,
[A] I do n't know what the percentages are ,
[A] but I heard it one time ,
[A] it 's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] uh-huh .
[A] And finally , you know , who knows
[A] maybe they 're finally waking up and saying , you know , we ca n't afford this .
[A] Uh , the U S is n't the threat that we 've always made them out to be ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] you know , even if they 're saying that beneath the doors .
[A] But it 's hard to thing that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Even if it is , you know , the best thing in the long run , it just steps on too many people 's toes ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] who are comfortable with the way the situation is .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I , I think , you know , what I 'd have to ,
-----
[B] I , I gues , I guess to answer the question directly , I 'm still just a , a little bit , you know , leery of the whole thing .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] What I have n't seen is the , uh , you know , a great stepping back in the military ,
[A] Right .
[B] situation .
[B] You know , it 's , it 's one thing , you know , to let us go ahead and sort of disarm
[B] and , you know , I even had a thought once that the whole Iraqi thing might have been just a , a deal to go ahead and let us , uh , you know ,
[A] Expend ?
[B] expend some , some military hardware .
[B] Of course , it did n't turn out that way .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , uh , uh , that , that may have been a , a , a kind of far out way of thinking about it I do n't know .
[A] Well , it 's interesting , anymore the world 's getting so small that it does n't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] philosophy that , that was here in ,
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] you know , twenty years ago .
[A] Uh , but , of course , the people who have challenged that or tried to do , on- , have cor- , have not been world powers .
[A] So , it 's easier for us to say , you know , to an Iraq , you know ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] uh , you ca n't do this , get back , you know , or we 're going to force you .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] or , or we can do something about it .
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] Whereas , you know , if the Soviet Union would have , who knows what taking over Mongolia or , or something like that , who is really , will we have been more just rhetoric ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] uh , rather than going in there officially or , you know ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] physically and try to , to remove them .
[B] Well , the , the China situation , you know , the when , it looked like that thing was , was turning around
[B] and all of a sudden it was like somebody in the , in the Red Square or wherever said , okay ,
[B] and that 's enough .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And the tanks came in and ,
[A] Exactly .
[B] you know , pretty much took care of that .
[B] And ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] uh , that ,
-----
[A] MUMBLEx personally I do n't see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat ,
[A] and I think he 's actually , honestly trying to do some change .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] But I do n't believe that he , in this first pass around , you know , being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Well , this would be like if somebody was elected president of the United States and suddenly took off toward , you know , just some pretty hard by the socialism ,
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and , uh , you know , the , the reaction , uh ,
[B] you know , the , the economic ,
[B] well , the , uh , the social structure of the Soviet Union , you know , it , it 's , it 's coming apart at the seams .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] You know , and I 've heard people say , well , you know , it 's just like the American Civil War , will there be a union or not ?
[B] Well , no ,
[B] it 's not the same sort of a thing at all because that , the whole Soviet system was put together under total force ,
[B] you know , there was no ,
[B] as , as we are seeing now with a lot of those ,
[A] Right .
[B] areas wanting out of it ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] you know , they , uh , nobody vo- ,
[B] you know , a lot
[B] man , those people did n't vote to become part of the Soviet Union ,
[B] they had no choice .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that was always kind of interesting ,
-----
[A] people ,
[A] you know , a lot of my friends have a taken us down , the stance of , you know , these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away
[A] and I 'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic ,
[A] you know , if I 'm a Soviet and if part of , you know , south , let 's say South Dakota wanted to succ , you know , succeed , am I going to stand for that .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Now I realize that the origins are , are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and that they may have been forced , I 'm not that familiar with their future ,
[A] but I , you know , I ,
[A] it 's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than , uh , a volunteer or willingness to join .
[B] Yeah .
[A] But ,
[B] There , there was the whole thing was put together , you know , by force .
-----
[B] There 's , there 's no , no real question about that .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And some of the countries that were forced in at th- , later dates is the three Baltic countries , you know , came in , in the forties ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and , uh , it 's , well , it 's not that they came in , it 's they were conquered by the Germans ,
[A] And then ,
[B] and then the Russians even ,
-----
[A] just never given back .
[B] took it back from the Germans and never bothered to give it back ,
[A] Yep .
[B] you know ,
[B] so . That 's a ,
[A] Well , that whole a ,
[B] a little different situation .
[A] the whole i- , idea if you look at the Russian history and I guess all countries the way it used to be is , the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers
-----
[A] and maybe , you know , more and more people are seeing , oh , countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer is n't going to help you ,
[A] you can ,
[A] well , I guess like ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] with , uh , Israel is a perfect example .
[A] The reason they have the Angolan Heights and the , the , uh , all their buffer area is between Jordan and the , the Sinai and , and Lebanon was just as a buffer
[A] but , you know , as you can see with the , the scuds go right over there .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] they do n't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] there 's , there 's very little that , that binds you anymore in today 's technology .
[B] I knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to Germany they said that 's the safest place in the world because if a war starts , all the bombs are going to go right over Germany
[B] and they 're going to land in other places ,
-----
[B] you know , that 's going to be the safest place to be .
[A] That 's probably very true .
[A] Ve- ,
[A] that 's very interesting , never thought of that .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] well , uh , I , I guess , what they 'd have to do to ,
[B] I really do n't know ,
-----
[B] you know , in , in the , in , you know , I hope that what 's happening is exactly the way it appears .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] You know , some reason or other , you know , is , uh , it 's kind of a strange thing we 've been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say ,
[A] Nobody knows what to do .
[B] whoa , wait a minute ,
-----
[B] you know . What 's , uh ,
[A] Is it real ?
[B] what 's , what 's really happening here .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But you wonder how , well , this thing ,
[B] w , who , was it Boris Yeltsin , the guy that 's running the , uh , or evidently was elected president of the Soviet ,
[A] Right .
[B] for the Russian republic ,
[A] Exactly .
[B] which is , I guess , the , uh , the biggest ,
[A] I get confused between all the , which is the Soviet provinces versus which are the , the Russian provinces ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] versus what are ,
-----
[B] Well , in the center
[B] but you got a , the , the great big area that 's just , was traditionally known as Russia
[B] and then all these little nationality groups ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] around it , you know , that were , you know , was there nineteen of them or , or whatever ,
[B] you know , and these were all the Soviet economists , us you know , they had some real fancy names for them .
[A] Right .
[B] Matter of fact when the ,
[B] uh , yeah ,
[B] what I read when the , uh , lee- , uh , United Nations was setup in , in San Francisco , one of the first things the Russians wanted to do was bring in each one of the , uh , of these , you know , republics ,
[A] Oh , as a ,
[B] as a separate country ,
[B] you know ,
[A] as a vote .
[B] so there would be , there would be nineteen ,
[A] Sure .
[B] rather than one .
[A] Sure .
[B] And , uh , the United States said , well , that mean we get to bring in forty-eight , you know .
[B] And , uh , that sort of ,
[B] you know , they backed down on that .
[A] Died down on that .
[A] I thought it was interesting that recently here the Warsaw Pact no longer exists as a militor , military force ,
-----
[A] but it 's merely an economic now .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] well , wonder if that ,
[A] Well , I mean at ,
-----
[B] wh , uh , w ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] exactly .
[B] what do you get shot by something that 's called a , an economic force or what is called a military pact ,
[B] you know , it 's all ,
[B] you can change the name of something
[B] but I wonder if it 's still , exists .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Although , I 've seen some evidence that , you know , the , uh , the Russian soldiers are ,
[B] well , you ,
[B] the funny thing there is they 're not particularly welcome back home because there 's , they 're having housing shortages now .
[B] What do you do with all these troops that have been taken care of by , uh , Bulgaria and ,
[A] Exactly
[A] and , and all the ,
[B] and Czechoslovakia
[B] and now all of a sudden they 're going home
[B] and somebody 's got to pay for their ,
[A] Well , that 's what they 're saying the whole problem , you know , with , if we were to demilitarize Europe ,
-----
[A] , what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there ?
[B] Yeah .
[B] Well , that 's not ,
[A] What 's going to happen to the economies that are no longer have a , a million plus people in the indu- , you know ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] in each country from the U S ...
