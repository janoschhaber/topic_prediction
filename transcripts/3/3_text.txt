[A] Well , the first thing for me is I wonder , I see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is , um , if privacy is something that disturbs your private state , I mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state ,
[A] that 's one thing ,
[A] and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it , in other words , finds something out about you that 's another .
[A] And the first kind of invasion of , the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me , and very much everyday in this country ,
[A] but in the second time , at least overtly , uh , where someone comes in and , uh , finds out information about you that should be private , uh , does not seem , uh , um , obviously , everyday .
[B] I , I think I agree with that .
[B] I think in a good example on the typical thing that happens , uh , when the phone rang
[B] and it 's T I calling ,
[B] my immediate reaction is that it 's some sort of strange phone message
[B] and then I realize , oh , no , this is something I solicited ,
[A] That 's right .
[B] so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion
[B] but after that I realized , no , I , I really wanted this
[B] and it was sort of exciting
[B] and so ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] that was almost an example of s- , an invasion that turns out to be not invasive .
[A] Right ,
[A] it turned out to be , uh , uh , an invitation .
[B] Exactly .
[B] Uh , and at the same time I think that I receive on , on the order of , uh , probably , seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it .
[A] From , from personal parties or from these , um , phone answer , phone , uh ,
[B] Commercial ,
[A] commercial things .
[B] sol- , solicitations primarily .
[A] Oh , that , that 's a remarkable number .
[A] I get them rarely
[A] and I 'm still astounded that , that one , they let anyone do them and two , that they have any effect in this whatsoever .
[A] Um , because I 'm usually so insulted by them I just hang up as soon as I recognize what ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] they are .
[A] I think they prey on people 's , um , inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine .
[A] I find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say ,
[A] and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there 's not even a person there .
[B] And I think that 's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control
[B] and you , one 's feeling obligated ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] because of some sense of , of the way the ritual is played out .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , and , uh , that , that then ends up being the , the most common example for me .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Um , I guess I 'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second , this one that you raised .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And I do n't think I would have thought about that .
[B] I think that 's a good idea on your part .
[B] I do n't typically feel intruded on , on the things , uh , the sense of finding out information .
[A] Well , presumably those who find out such information , if they are doing it , I would prefer to not to be known ,
[A] and , I mean , you know , the classic , oh , I do n't know C I A conspiracy theories or whatever , would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge .
[A] So there 's , , things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it ,
[A] and I ca n't talk about the second one other than to , to , to generate paranoia .
[A] It 's a surmise
[A] and ,
[B] To , to surmise . It is there .
[A] I 'd like to think that it 's quite low , at least in this country .
[A] I do n't think I 'd like the K G B is monitoring my phone or anything like that .
[B] Well , I guess , although , I , well , that 's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is ,
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] yeah .
[B] because , uh , if that 's the case of a tree falling in the forest
[B] and I 'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy has n't been because I have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[B] Uh ,
[A] uh-huh ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] if you 're defining it in terms of information gone even if it 's something you do n't know about it , well , then I guess one could assume one was invaded
[B] but I do n't feel invaded by it .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[B] I do n't ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things ,
[B] I 'm not sure why .
[B] Uh , I guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts
[B] and if someone finds out something about me that is true , I , I do n't have a sense of loss from that .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Well , you must have a relatively clean conscience then .
[B] Um , the , the other side of that might be if , if someone found out something or surmised something that were n't true then I would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense .
[A] Yes ,
[A] yes ,
[A] ev- , more harmed or something .
[B] Bec- ,
[B] right ,
[B] because ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] you do n't have anyway to turn it off .
[B] Tho- ,
[B] did you hear about this Lotus data base that was being put together ?
[A] Yes ,
[A] I did .
[A] I was just about to write a letter when I heard they canceled it .
[B] That would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because I would find that there be , cou- , a good possibly that their facts were , were fantasy .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] And then I would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from a , that I would rather they did n't
[B] and that might be the sense of the spending pattern , for instance ,
[A] Uh-huh , uh-huh .
[B] that , that I would have thought to be private .
[B] But then if it turns out to generate incorrect things , that 's even worse
[B] so ,
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] or if my call rate of , of eight t- , or so a week went up even higher because ,
[B] uh , someone had , had ,
[A] They had you pegged .
[B] Right .
[B] And the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money
[B] and then all of ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] a sudden you get your thirty a week because now ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] they 're advertising you .
[B] Right .
[B] Exactly .
[A] Yeah .
[A] And , um , one of the problems with the Lotus data base was , um , that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information .
[A] I mean , they said they would give it out to only select companies
[A] but , um , you know , just like software is only given out to customers ,
[A] I mean , you ca n't believe that .
[B] Right .
[B] Right .
[A] It would , it would be pirated
[A] and they would n't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who 's offering , you know , full cash price ,
[B] Right .
[A] for it .
[A] I mean , you know , you ca n't tell it , what a company really has to do with it
[A] and there 's something rather ominous about having virtually anyone , any hacker being able to know what your income is , what your spending habits are ,
[A] and , you know , and , and that hacker just has to get in to , in touch with the sneak thief
[A] and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] And I guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you 're feeling ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] threatened as a result of , of it
[B] so ,
[A] Yes .
[A] Exactly .
[B] maybe that is a , a little bit of what privacy is .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] I also thought about it , was of , uh , waiting to talk to you that , another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because I know how to behave such that there is n't .
[A] But I realized I have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy .
[A] If I deviate from social norms of behavior , if I run up and down the street yelling or something , someone 's going to invade my privacy very quickly .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And I realize that that , I mean , I can take that for granted
[A] but I used to , I used to live in India
[A] and things are quite different there in terms of that .
[A] There 's less of a sense of privacy .
[A] In fact , it 's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy ,
[A] certainly the language I know does n't ,
[B] Oh , that 's interesting .
[A] but just says a word for loneliness .
[A] Loneliness is the closest you can come , which is really quite different .
[B] But , but no concept for wanting to be private .
[A] Yeah .
[A] It 's , it 's generally being alone is not a very desirable state , at least officially .
[B] Okay .
[A] Um , so there 's not ,
[A] I mean , doors do n't have latches on them .
[A] People do n't tend to knock ,
[A] you just ,
[A] if there 's a door closed and you open it because it 's in your way
[A] you , people walk in out
[A] and , as a , as a westerner in India , and I was often surprised ,
[B] Oh .
[B] That , that would be ,
[A] and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded .
[B] That would be culturally shocking .
[A] You know , it very much is .
[A] But on the other hand , I realized I could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and people would leave ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] me alone .
[A] Whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much , if you go out and then act like the lunatic you , you violate the , uh , the norms of social , of , um , public behavior .
[A] Um , people start paying attention to you very much
[A] and they start asking questions and in the sense are invite- , invade , invading your privacy although , if you know what the social norms are , you know , quote unquote , you asked for it .
[A] But it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms .
[B] Yes .
[A] And which is n't of , always the case in all cultures ,
[A] and it was n't until I was thinking about it just now that I realized that 's actually something that 's culturally relative .
[B] Tha- , that is true .
[B] I have n't thought about that
[B] and , and that it 's fascinating to , to think a lot of someone who does n't know how to say private .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] uh-huh .
[A] And that 's really , um ,
[A] well , I mean , I , I wonder how people have sex ,
[A] and things like that ,
[A] I mean , they a- , ,
[A] you go to India
[A] and it 's obvious , you know , the results of sex are quite obvious , , as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years .
[A] Um , but I , I just do n't quite , um ,
[A] there 's hope , I actually for al- ,
[A] of the time I 've spent there , I still do n't quite understand how certain things that I assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy .
[B] Yes .
[A] Because anyone can be alone for some period of time
[A] but for me a lot of what I do requires a sense that there 's this invisible barrier around me which people wil ,
[B] Yes .
[A] will respect .
[A] And if that 's gone , um , I , I really do n't know how to live very well ,
[A] and I wonder , I really do wonder how people do that .
[B] That 's interesting .
[B] Are th- , are there any other specific things that , that you feel like , where , where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either on a growing frequency ?
[A] All the class , the other classic examples , the Jehovah 's Witness or , or Mormons or someone knocking at the front door , um , which is more intrusive because I have to really tell someone to go away .
[A] And there 's that sense of , I have now opened my door they now see what I look like , what I live like
[A] and nor- , and they 're doing something that normally I really only invite ,
[B] Okay .
[A] people to .
[A] Because I , any , anyone , any friend , anyone I give my number to is welcome to call me ,
[A] but no one is just welcome to come by my house .
[A] So that is more of a sense of invasion .
[B] So , that 's another example of the invasion because of the not so ...
