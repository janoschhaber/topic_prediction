[A] I do n't know , um ,
[A] do you do a lot of camping ?
[B] Well , my husband and I have n't done a whole lot of camping ,
[B] we , but we bought a van last year ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and we were hoping , uh , to do some camping in the van , um ,
[B] we did go camping in Arkans- , not Arkansas , Oklahoma .
[B] Uh , last year in , we camped in a tent ,
[B] and , uh , there were two other couples with us
[B] and there was , uh , state park .
[A] Oh , so MUMBLEx ,
[B] And it was really nice .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] um , up here some of the state parks are really nice
[A] and some of them are n't ,
[A] some of them are pretty rough .
[B] Really ?
[A] Um , yeah ,
[A] they , they just have like outhouses ,
[A] they do n't have like a shower room or anything ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] but some of them are really nice
[A] they have showers and full bathrooms ,
[B] Um .
-----
[A] um , but I do n't know ,
[A] I , I 've been camping a couple times
[A] but I 'm not a real avid camper , uh ,
[A] a lot of people I know are ,
[A] but , um , I do n't , I do n't MUMBLEx .
[B] I , I do n't like really camping in the rough .
[B] I like the , the , the little necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that .
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] MUMBLEx we went , we went once to a lean-to
[A] and it , um ,
[A] I mean , there was n't any electricity on the camp site
[A] but it was all right ,
[A] we only spent two nights there .
[A] I would n't want to spend more than two nights .
[A] I would n't want to go for like a week ,
[A] but , um ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that would , that would be much .
[A] two nights is good .
[A] Um , especially there was a little store close by ,
[A] so , it was pretty nice .
[B] Yeah ,
-----
[B] the campsite that we went to was an area that ,
[B] it 's right on a big lake ,
[B] and there 's a lot of boating out there ,
[B] and we , we went up there to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit
[B] but it was still , uh , it was still , too , cold .
[A] Oh , really ?
[A] Oh .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it , it was pretty early in the year .
[A] Um , yeah ,
[A] up here you got to wait until , Aug- , August , until the water warms up .
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] Well , it 's not that bad
[A] but it 's still pretty chilly .
[A] Um , I do n't know ,
[A] I was , I have a tent
[A] and I fluff out in it , in the backyard and stuff ,
[A] but this thing about camping that bothers me is you 've got to pack everything
[A] and another thing is the thing seems to get ,
[A] it 's dirty you know ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] so , you ca n't keep the dirt out of the tent .
[A] I do n't know
[A] we have a seven year old ,
[A] it 's pretty funny ,
[A] like stay out .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] we , we have , we have a dog
[B] and that 's just about as bad as a kid .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] boy , he does n't go in and out of the tent a hundred times .
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] And use it as a play , uh ,
[A] they like to play in them .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I do n't know how you can really keep , uh , the inside of a tent clean .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I do n't know .
[B] Other than , you know , taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and , and sweeping it out everyday , it 's really hard to , to keep the sand and dirt out of it .
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] well , what we were doing , we were just going to say , we 're just going to sleep in the tent and hang out at night , so , you know , no going in and out , and , or what he wants to do ,
[A] we had brought his friend along , was play in the tent .
[A] It was like , no , this is not working , ,
[A] you ca n't do that ,
[A] you get the tent all dirty .
[B] Did ,
-----
[A] Plus you get it all wet ,
[A] we were at a beach site , too .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Um , did you have another , a big tent , like uh , um , like a , looks like a sitting area type , you know , like a two room type MUMBLEx ?
[A] No ,
-----
[A] but , you know , I was just thinking of getting one those for the yard because they are really nice
[A] and , um , up here we have , uh , we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] we do n't really have a problem with that , um , in these areas , um ,
[B] and even , even when in Oklahoma when we camped I really did n't notice a problem with bugs .
[B] And I noticed that ,
[B] I know that I said , that 's ,
[B] I 've , I 've lived back east before , um , they ,
[A] They 're terrible ,
-----
[A] they 're really terrible .
[A] Uh , but , there 's this one campsite , that it ,
[A] just some of them are known
[A] but there is one that 's out in this big lake
[A] and its , its , its , mosquitoes are terrible
[A] and then there 's this , there 's this other one that 's more up in the mountains
[A] but it surrounds a man-made reservoir
[A] and there 's no bugs ,
[A] that 's the whole thing that everyone told me , oh ,
[A] I 'm , I was going to go to , Lit- , Little River State Park ,
[A] MUMBLEx that place is great ,
[A] there 's no bugs .
[B] Huh .
[A] But , oh ,
[A] okay ,
[A] because , uh , we were having a really big problem up here in certain areas ,
[A] we were really affected bad by it , but really got it , um ,
[A] almost destroyed the ch- , the tourism in one town , because of the mosquitoes ,
[A] they 're so , bad .
[B] Really ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that was , it 's a really nice area ,
[A] I 've been there before
[A] and it 's ,
[A] I , I could n't imagine ge- , living just sixty miles north of them
[A] but they were plagued , they were plagued with them , with mosquitoes .
[A] And you can go out , outside in the daytime , all right ,
[A] but the minute the sun went down , um , that 's when it 's usually , the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out .
[B] Huh .
-----
[A] I mean , just the very second ,
[A] it 's really strange .
[A] They , uh , they must , uh , work on that , you know ,
[A] the , i- , it gets cooler when the sun sets
[A] and then they all come out .
[B] Well , have you ever , have you ever taken any of those , um , what do they call this , MUMBLEx lights ,
-----
[B] have you ever used those ?
[A] Oh , yeah ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] I never really noticed how effective they were ,
[A] but , um , because that was n't really ,
[A] I bought them , MUMBLEx
[A] I really did n't get to use them like , oh , there 's mosquitoes let 's turn them .
[A] We just sort of lit them .
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] And , um , we were n't bothered that much by mosquitoes ,
[A] so , we did n't really contribute it to that .
[A] But , um , I think in an area that 's really thick with mosquitoes ,
[A] I ca n't see all this little , uh , smoke buckets I call them ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] MUMBLEx they work ,
[A] but they 're suppose to work really well .
[B] Huh .
[A] Oh , I 'm in my paperwork here ,
[A] that 's what I do when I wait for a phone call ,
[A] I get in my paperwork . Oh , to find my most important parts .
[A] But I do n't know , I do n't know if I 'm going to go ,
[A] I wish was an avid camper
[A] and I could really talk about like gardening or something ,
[A] you can talk about that a lot ,
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] but , um , I do want to go again .
[A] We just moved to a new hou- , into a house ,
[A] so , I do n't think camping ,
[A] maybe in the backyard ,
[A] but I do n't see going on a camping trip probably until next summer .
[B] Yeah ,
-----
[B] I 'd , I 'd like to go camping cross-country , um ,
[B] I just got married less than two years ago ,
[B] so , we do n't have any , any children yet , um ,
[A] So , it 's easy for you to go .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] so , easy to pick up and go , and , s- ,
[B] we have a van
[B] and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it .
[A] Um , oh , God .
-----
[B] So , it 's not really , I guess , camping the way peop- , most people picture camping in the tent
[B] but ,
[A] I do n't know
[A] but that sounds that my , my kind of camping , it really does .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] okay , um , well , um ,
[A] that is MUMBLEx is to have a , a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it , plus your tent .
[B] Yeah ,
-----
[B] or , or get ,
[B] my brother has a real nice pop-up .
[A] Yep .
[B] And he just , he just tows it behind his truck .
[A] Um ,
[B] And he , he 's got three kids ,
[B] so , his kids will sleep in the truck , in the , in the back of the bed .
[B] Um , and they sleep in the pop-up .
[A] Well , those , they 're kind of nice
[A] but they 're also , um , flimsy when you really look at them .
[A] But when you get inside they 're really nice , you know ,
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] everything 's really ,
[A] but then when you look underneath them , it 's just got these little wheels and this MUMBLEx little axle ,
[A] it 's like , oh , my
[A] and then a big windstorm it would pick you up .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] he did have a problem , uh , when he went camping last year in Beavers Bend , Ok- , Oklahoma , um ,
[B] a , a storm came in
[B] and it started raining really heavy
[B] and they were all , everybody was trying to flee the campsite ,
[B] , everybody was getting stuck in the mud .
[A] Oh , jeez ,
[B] And , uh ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] what do you , what do you do when you get a , I mean , like a really violent storm like a tornado ,
[A] just stay in your truck .
[A] I mean , I would n't stay in the , um ,
[B] Well , theirs was so bad ,
[B] and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up ,
[A] Oh .
[B] and they had to get out of there .
[A] So , then , were they successful ?
[B] Yeah ,
[B] they , yeah , they were .
[A] But it took them a little while ?
[B] But , yeah ,
[B] they they decided that , that was enough camping for the weekend .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] so , did they get stuck ?
[B] No ,
[B] they ended up getting out .
[B] They ended up helping several other people though that were , that were stuck .
[A] Yeah , huh .
[A] Well , so , they evacuated it .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] they , the whole , the whole campsite was evacuated .
[A] Wow .
[B] I mean some , I think some people that had fairly sturdy , um , vehicles or whatever if they had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water , I think they stayed .
[A] Yeah .
[B] But everybody that was real close to the water ended up ,
[B] it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream .
[A] I know I always I like MUMBLEx to get right on the water ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] by the campsite , it 's so ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] MUMBLEx we have lean-tos up here .
[A] I really like them ,
[A] like I say , they 're kind of , just kind of more sturdy than anything , you know ,
[A] just , just ,
[B] They have them right at the campsites ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] they 're , they 're lean-tos .
[B] Wow .
[A] Yeah , they 're pretty nice ,
[A] they 're , they 're , uh , it 's like a little house except the whole face is open ,
[A] and the one time that we went , we got one ,
[A] it was overlooking the water
[A] but it was a big embankment ,
[A] I wanted to get one right on the water .
[A] MUMBLEx we had an electrical storm too ,
[A] and it was really , it was neat sitting there watching it ,
[A] I mean , it was raining ,
[A] when we called MUMBLEx home , everybody said , oh , we were worried about you in that storm ...
