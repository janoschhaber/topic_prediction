[A] What type of lawn and garden work do you do ?
[B] Well , I do it all .
[A] I see .
[A] Do you have a garden ?
[B] Uh , yes .
[B] I , I try to grow , uh , uh , a vegetable garden
[B] and ,
[A] We do the same thing .
[A] It 's , I just have a small plot it 's like ten feet by five feet .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I have two plots ,
[B] one 's ten by ten
[B] and one 's like fifteen by four .
[A] I see .
[B] It 's a long skinny one
[B] and ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] you do a lot more area than I do .
[A] I 've ,
[A] all the rest of my yard , backyard is , uh , you know , pool and decking
[A] it 's all the dirt I have ,
[B] Oh , I see .
[A] left in my backyard .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I see .
[A] Well , I enj , I enjoy fiddling around .
[A] It 's cheap entertainment .
[B] Right .
[B] Right .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it 's nice to get out in the open air .
[A] It is ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] And especially when the weather 's not too hot or ,
[A] That 's right .
[B] not raining or whatever ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] but , uh ,
[A] I enjoy ,
[B] sometimes I ,
[A] Excuse me , go ahead .
[B] I said , I sometimes I wish I had more space --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- you know .
[B] I grow a lot of things , a lot of food .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And sometimes I , I want to plant something , there 's not enough room to plant .
[A] That 's right .
[A] That 's right .
[B] Some of those things like , uh , you know , the things that vine like , uh , cucumbers ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] or , uh , squash or something ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] like that .
[A] Takes a lot of room .
[B] Plant one of those
[B] and it takes up your whole space .
[A] It sure does .
[A] I made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe ,
[A] my goodness ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] what a mistake that was .
[B] Yeah .
[B] They , they just run all over ,
[A] They do .
[B] the place , do n't they ,
[A] Well , it was very good
[A] it just takes up , you know , like you say , a lot of your garden area .
[B] Right .
[B] Right .
[B] MUMBLEx .
[A] It 's the first and only time I 've done that .
[A] We do n't do anything exotic
[A] we just do , oh ,
[B] The basics .
[A] tomatoes , bell peppers ,
[B] Right .
[A] radishes and turnips , I mean , not turnips , carrots , beets and things like that .
[B] Yeah .
[B] That 's what we do too .
[A] My wife used to plant a few snow peas .
[A] I do n't really care for snow peas .
[A] Well , she just plants a few for herself .
[B] Right .
[B] Peas --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- I , I got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago .
[A] Did you really ?
[B] The first one , they started them indoors this time .
[B] I read it ,
[A] Oh , I see .
[B] And so I ,
[A] Okay .
[A] We do n't start anything indoors
[A] we ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] just wait until , you know , the weather warm enough to stick it in the ground .
[B] I , uh , I guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that ,
[A] Probably so .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] you can get a head start on it .
[B] But , uh , sure is a heck of a lot of work .
[A] I guess it , it ,
[B] Because you got to ,
[A] might would ,
[A] yeah .
[B] watch them every day ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and keep them watered
[B] and I , I do n't think I 'll do it again .
[A] Well it will make , it will make them taste better I 'm sure .
[B] Oh , yeah .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I enjoy it .
[B] I come home from work
[B] and , and I usually say hello to wife and kids ,
[A] Sure .
[B] and then go out and fiddle , you know , just walk around the yard and --
[A] You got to inspect it ,
[A] yeah .
[B] -- inspect it
[B] and the kids want to swing ,
[A] Sure .
[B] and I push them on swing .
[A] Sure .
[B] And I wal- , I mow my own lawn .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And I do , I do n't have a sprinkler system .
[B] I , I do n't enjoy watering .
[A] No .
[B] Especially ,
[A] I ,
[A] this is the first home we 've lived in we 've had a sprinkler system ,
[B] Oh how ,
[A] and boy , it is really nice ,
[B] Oh .
[A] it sure beats dragging hoses around .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] you can have it come on just early in the morning .
[A] That 's right .
[B] And , and off by the , you know , by the time you 're up and about .
[A] That 's right .
[A] It 's really nice .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I , I usually get it started for my wife --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and I , and she moves it around ever other day .
[A] I 'll have to admit I do n't , I do my own yard .
[A] I , I really do n't enjoy doing that .
[A] I enjoy having a nice looking yard ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I just do n't enjoy the work ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] that it takes to get it done .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I had a lawn service to do my yard for me --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- during the real hot summer months , you know , until I retired
[A] and now I , I 've lost my excuse for that so I have to ,
[A] for the last couple of years I 've done it myself .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Sometimes I wish I could get one of these , uh , chemical services to come ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] out and spray for weeds ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and fertilize ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and all that and take that one step out of MUMBLEx .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But , uh , they want too much money .
[A] It is kind of expensive ,
[A] it is .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Of course , the chemicals themselves when you buy them , they 're expensive too .
[B] Right .
[B] Right .
[B] But it 's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself .
[A] That 's right .
[A] If I have a problem discipline , you know , I think ,
[A] now , boy , I really need to get out , you know , and apply something , you know ,
[A] and I screw around and do n't do it or wait too long or something .
[B] Right
[B] and the weed come up ,
[A] That 's right .
[B] and all of a sudden you 've got to do something else .
[A] That 's right .
[A] I 'm , I 'm kind of bad about that .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I enjoyed having a lawn service
[A] but now I have the time
[A] and I really ca n't , I really don- , you know , do n't ,
[B] Well , if you ,
[A] want to spend the money for it .
[B] enjoy it too ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] you know , you , you can get out in the morning when , before it gets hot and ,
[A] That 's right .
[B] and do it and stuff ,
[A] I 'm not limited to ,
[B] when you only have to ,
[A] just mowing it on Saturday morning , you know ,
[B] Right .
[A] I can do it on most any day of the week .
[B] When the days start getting a little longer ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] you know , you can , I can start doing it in the evening after work .
[A] That 's right .
[B] When they , when they switch to ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] switch ,
[B] when we get an hour more ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] when they rollback an hour .
[A] That 's coming up here pretty soon .
[A] Is it this weekend ?
[B] I do n't know .
[A] It 's pretty soon .
[B] I really do n't know .
[B] It just seems like I here it on the news the day before .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And , uh , I , I think it 's coming up here soon .
[A] I believe it is too .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Well ,
[B] Are you having any trouble with bugs in , in your garden ?
[A] Uh , not a whole lot , uh .
[A] I , I do n't use , I , I seldom use anything harsher than seven dust , you know .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I do n't really like to put a lot chemicals on it
[A] but then ,
[B] Right .
[A] again , I do n't want the bugs eating it upping either .
[B] Right .
[B] I , I ,
[B] it seems like they come in spurts .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] One year I did n't put anything on
[B] and I did n't have any problems .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Next year I was planting some broccoli and , and some of those , they 're called cabbage ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] cabbage loppers ,
[A] Right .
[B] or whatever .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] They were just covered with them ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] I mean , I went up ,
[B] I did n't go out there for about three days , you know ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] because I , and I went out there one day and the plant was noth- , nothing left but a stem ,
[A] That 's right .
[B] they devoured it that quickly .
[A] Absolutely .
[A] They really go through it ,
[B] And , they , they ,
[A] they really do .
[B] have a , you , a good appetite .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And they would , you know ,
[B] I , I picked off like twenty of them
[B] and ,
[A] You know cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too .
[B] Ye- ,
[B] yeah .
[A] Boy , they 'll strip ,
[B] They got that , uh , what is that safer soap , uh ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] B T spray this ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] year .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And I 've been watching them every day
[B] and I 've , and I have n't seen any signs yet .
[B] So , if I see any signs I 'm going to spray them ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and , uh ,
[A] I did something a little bit different this year that I have n't done before ,
[A] I 've got ,
[A] my garden is shaped that I can ,
[A] it 's kind like this , uh , box shape ,
[A] so I got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box .
[B] Right .
[A] And put in a whole bunch like eight hundred pounds of topsoil and manure
[A] and , you know , various other things ,
[B] Well , the good stuff .
[A] Raised it up .
[B] Right .
[A] And I 'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe I wo n't have , oh , I 'll have less of a bug problem
[A] any- , at least they , they 'll have a hard time crawling up the thing .
[B] Right .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] my backyard is , uh , is sloping
[B] so I built a box up , you know --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- had to build the one , the low side up .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , uh , I had sandy loam hauled in .
[B] I had a dump truck come and dump it .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] On my driveway , I guess , that 's what they do
[B] and then ,
[A] Yeah ,
[B] I had to wheel barrow it in .
[A] Right .
[B] But , uh , you know , you can improve your own soil there --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- but the Texas soil is n't the greatest ,
[A] That 's right ,
[B] gardening soil .
[A] you , you have to work on .
[A] You ,
[B] Right .
[A] really do .
[B] And you know , if I , I did n't wait five years for it to be good enough grow
[B] you know what I mean .
[A] That 's right .
[A] When we had our pool done I had them to leave some extra loam , you know , for my garden
[A] so I had , I had a lot of loam out there to start with
[A] I just turned it all up and mixed it all up together --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- with ,
[B] Do you have , do you have a rotor tiller ?
[A] No .
[A] I do n't ,
[A] I did it by hand ,
[B] Small enough ,
[B] you have a ,
[B] just do it by hand ?
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Yeah .
[A] It was n't too much of a job ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] really .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Like I say it 's just ,
[B] Yeah .
[B] I 'd like to get one of these little small ones ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] that you see in all these gardening magazines .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] It would be handy .
[B] And it weighs twenty pounds or ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] something like that .
[B] My neighbor across the street has one .
[B] He always uses it to dethatch his lawn ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I see him out there ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and I guess it has a thatcher attachment to it .
[A] It might be handy ,
[B] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[A] They 're pretty neat little ,
[A] I 've never seen one .
[B] I have a friend who has one
[B] and , and he lets me , you know , no problem borrowing if it 's ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] just a hassle when you know ,
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] to go up
[B] and it 's a fairly large one to ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] heave it up into the back of the van ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] bring it home and ,
[A] Right .
[B] check it back and just grab it , you know , if I , just go to my garage and grab it .
[A] Yeah .
[A] That would be neat ,
[A] sure .
[B] That would be nice .
[A] We 've had a garden , gosh , for years and years and years ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] of some size , you know ,
[A] I ca n't remember a year when we did n't have one of some kind .
[B] What have you got growing right now ?
[A] Uh , got ,
[A] you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and , uh , I 've got carrots , I mea- , yes , I 've got a few carrots up
[A] and I 've got some radishes up ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and as a matter of fact , I 've already done a second row of radishes .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And , uh , the green onions are coming along .
[B] Okay ,
[A] Snow ,
[B] what kind ,
[A] excuse me .

[A] Yes ,
[A] I 've
[A] for the first time we planted them this year .
[B] Oh , they , they are the best .
[A] Yeah .
[A] We tried to find them last year ,
[A] we screwed around and waited too long
[A] and I could n't find a nursery that had any of them left .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] But we 've got some this year .
[B] Uh , those ,
[A] Snow peas are up
[A] and , uh , my wife does , uh , a small herb garden on the side .
[B] I see .
[A] They 're up and doing fine .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I , uh ,
[B] those onions , I think , we , we planted like twice as much this year because , you know , we got , on- , onions
[B] and they lasted from , you know , about when you harvest them about a month from now or so ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] or six weeks ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] from now ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] until , until like October ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and , uh , we really missed them when they were gone ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] because the ones from the grocery store just ca n't ,
[A] Yeah .
[A] That 's kind of a ,
[B] compare .
[A] let down .
[B] She made these onion rings that were so good ,
[A] Oh , I bet ,
[B] and , and ,
[A] they were .
[B] and , uh , you do n't realize how many dishes you put onions in ,
[A] That 's right .
[A] We use a lot ,
[B] that it 's an ingredient ,
[A] we sure do .
[B] and , and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better .
[A] Yeah .
[A] One nice thing with onions and , and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have ,
[B] Right .
[A] you know , too many .
[B] Right .
[B] We froze a lot of peppers .
[B] We let some turn red .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] We did that too ,
[B] And some we do green
[B] and then my wife puts them on pizzas .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , and chops them up in recipes --
[A] Sure .
[A] Makes , uh ,
[B] -- and things like that .

[B] Oh , yeah .
[B] Put them in salad ,
[B] yeah .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] You 're , you 're making me hungry here .
[A] We planted some yellow peppers this year .
[A] We 've tried it ,
[B] Oh .
[A] before
[A] and nope ,
[A] we have n't had much luck with it we 're going to try it again this year .
[B] Yellow peppers , huh .
[A] They have some little buds on them hopefully they 'll do something .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Sounds like you have a real good garden .
[A] Yeah .
[A] We enjoy fooling around with it .
[B] Just let me see what I got ,
[B] I got the peas
[B] and I 've got some broccoli , uh , onions some , some radishes and , uh , uh , beets .
[A] Beets .
[A] Yeah ,

[A] I 've never done potato .
[A] We used to do it at home when I was a kid ,
[B] Oh , the potato ,
[A] had a huge garden .
[B] They were , they 're delicious
[B] but they ,
[B] you do n't get , seem to get that much for the space ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] they , they do .
[A] It takes a , yeah , it does take some space .
[B] Some beet , uh , potatoes
[A] Yeah .
[B] MUMBLEx and I 've got some tomatoes still growing ,

[A] yeah .
[A] Absolutely ,
[A] they 're expensive .
[B] I know it .
[B] I said , why are they so expensive they 're just a bunch of little cucumbers , you know ?
[A] I do n't know unless it ,
[A] labor intensive or something .
[A] I really ,
[B] I guess .
[A] do n't know .
[B] But we 're going to try that ,
[A] That will be interesting .
[B] and see how that works .
