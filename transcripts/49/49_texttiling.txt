[A] So what do you think about it ?
[A] How are we doing in recycling ?
[A] Are we ,
[B] Well , I think we need to do more .
[B] I mean , I know I need to do more .
[B] They have programs around where you can reach the , uh ,
[B] they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But I have a hard time of being able , of separating , you know , having a place , separating my trash ,
[B] and get all the --
[A] Yeah .
-----
[B] -- cans from the paper ,
[B] and , you know , I just have n't gotten that dedicated yet .
[B] So .
[A] I do a lot of work with the boy scouts ,
[A] and we try to do a lot --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- but there 's still a lot more we can do .
[B] Yeah .
[A] You know , I do n't recycle my newspapers myself ,
[A] but I noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a , like a , a clothes hamper kind of thing that , you know , you lay your string in , then you put your papers in there --
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] -- tie them all up and bundle them up ,
[A] so I figured I might get me one of those --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- because we do n't always read the newspaper .
[A] Sometimes it just sits around for a while ,
[A] and then we just chuck it .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] well , I do n't , I do n't get the paper every day ,
[B] but , you know , I get it on ,
[B] I try to buy , you know , the early edition for the coupons , you know , the Sunday edition .
[B] So .
[A] Yeah .
-----
[B] But , then I just , you know , bundle it up and put it on the front , you know , the front walk ev- , --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- you know , every Monday or every other Monday , and have them pick that up ,
[B] but that 's the extent of what I 've done .
[B] I 'd like to be able to do more .
[B] The problem is , with a lot of it is , you have to go , you know , it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it , you know --
[A] Yeah
-----
[A] see , and ,
[B] -- it 's not always convenient to do it .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] see , and here in Lubbock everything 's so close .
[A] I can imagine what it 's like up there .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I 'm not exactly sure where the , you know , the can thing is ,
[B] but , you know , sometimes it 's just so ,
[B] seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash , and have --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them .
[A] See , I went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago , as a matter of fact , and got me one of those little can crushers that I could put on the wall --
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] -- and then I put me a little five gallon bucket ,
[A] and it 's just outside the garage door --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket .
[B] Do those can crushers work good ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I got one from Payless Cashways ,
[A] and it 's actually metal --
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] -- it 's not plastic .
[A] I did n't want to buy a plastic one .
[B] Yeah
[B] because those things I think would just snap --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- you know .
[A] But Payless Cashways has them
[A] and they 're metal ,
[A] and I do n't know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there ,
[A] but it was only like seven dollars , not too bad .
[B] Oh .
[B] I 'd have to check into something like that , because , I mean , we do n't drink a whole lot of soda around here , you know ,
[B] but , um --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- you know , occasionally we have some around ,
[B] but , you know , for other kind of cans , just to , it 'd probably only take aluminum cans like that , do n't they .
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] I do n't ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] I do n't think it would crush steel cans ,
[A] it 's pretty tough .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] so . I do n't know ,
[B] I do n't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that ,
[B] but ,
[A] No ,
[A] you could probably just , you know ,
[B] I need to look into it more ,
[B] you know , it 's , you know , it ,
[B] sometimes , even with the newspaper they say they 'll only take certain types of paper , you know ,
[B] they wo n't take --
[A] Yeah --
-----
[B] -- paper that 's shiny ,
[A] -- they wo n't , yeah , they wo n't take any lint free paper
[A] or , see , I work at T I .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] so does my husband ,
[B] yeah .
[A] We do a lot of recycling out there .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard ,
[A] but that 's just now come on board .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] You know , we 've been throwing paper out there away for years ,
[A] and we 're just now getting on board to recycling --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- ever since this big Earth Day thing came out , you know .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I do n't know what ,
[B] you know , I have n't ,
[B] I 'm sure they 're probably doing that here some .
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] I 'm sure they are .
[A] T I is doing it pretty well nation-wide , I 'm sure .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] I think it 's necessary ,
[B] I , I like it ,
[B] you know , it makes ,
[B] I think it 's good that you see these , you know , like boxes , cereal ,
[B] they 're now starting to make them , you know , the packages out of recycled paper ,
[B] and ,
[A] Oh , yeah .
-----
[B] And I 've bought , you know , I 've bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper ,
[B] and I think they 're just fine .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I bought a ,
[A] I got one at work that I bought for one of the guys there at work ,
[A] it 's his birthday ,
[A] we 're pretty good friends ,
[A] and what it is is a recycled paper bag --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and it 's just got Happy Birthday printing on it , and a cute little phrase inside ,
[A] and it 's just a paper bag --
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] -- you know , and it 's really cute .
[B] Yeah .
[A] But , I think we 're doing better and better all the time ,
[B] Yeah --
[A] MUMBLEx still do n't ,
[B] -- I think we 're getting , becoming more conscious because we just ca n't stick everything in landfills any more .
[B] So .
[A] No ,
[A] there 's not going to be any room , shortly .
[B] No ,
[B] no ,
[B] the office ,
[A] I do n't know what New York does about theirs .
[A] I guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it 's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] so . But I think we 're getting better at it --
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] -- I think there 's quite a bit more we could do .
[B] Girls , put that away .
[B] Now .
[A] But , you 're right sometimes it does seem like it 's more trouble than what it would be worth .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I just wish it was a little more conv , convenient --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- to do ,
[B] you know , seems like you 're so busy anyway ,
[B] and then that 's just one more thing to have to worry about .
[B] So .
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] it sure is .
[B] I think if , you know , the cities , locally , you know , they 'd get more programs going so that you could do that , it 'd make it a lot easier .
[B] So .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[A] Well , they 'll get at it sooner .
[A] I guess the schools will get into it , too , sooner or later .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] get the kids --
[A] You know they have ,
[B] -- interested in it too .
[A] We tried to have an aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that I have ,
-----
[A] and we just do n't have any place to store those kind of cans .
[B] Yeah .
[A] You know , if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people , sure they 'll save them for us , there 's no problem there .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] But what do you do with them in the meantime ?
[B] That 's right .
[A] Now I do n't want a can , a garage full of cans .
[B] That 's right ,
[B] who does .
[B] You know --
[A] You know .
[B] -- people do n't have room for that kind of stuff .
[A] No ,
[A] they 're just not , they 're not prepared for it .
[B] No ,
[B] and in Texas , they 're just get , things like that ,
[B] they just get bugs in them .
[B] So .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] they do .
[B] So , you do n't ,
[A] You know , the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get ,
[A] that 's for sure .
[B] That 's right ,
[B] so .
[A] So .
[B] I 'm pretty lazy about it right now .
[B] Everything goes into one thing and goes out to the .
[A] Yeah .
[B] You know , pick it up .
[B] So .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] myself .
[A] About the only thing I really recycle around here is aluminum cans .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] So .
[B] Well , I need to get , get better at it .
[B] So .
[A] Well , if we all try a little bit , a little bit goes a long way .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's right ,
[B] that 's right .
[A] If everybody tries to do just a little bit , and a little bit more then --
[B] That 's true .
[A] -- we 'll get there .
[B] That 's right .
[A] Well --
[B] Huh .
[A] -- thank you for talking to me .
[B] Well , thank you for calling .
[B] I ,
[A] Sure ,
[A] no problem ,
[B] Okay ,
[B] take care .
[A] All right ,
[B] Bye-bye .
[A] Bye-bye .
