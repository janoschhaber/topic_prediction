[A] Well , ironically enough I 'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because I resumed an aerobics class the night before last .
-----
[B] Oh , no .
[A] I ripped the ligaments in my right ankle .
[B] Gosh .
[A] Yeah
[A] so ,
[B] Exercise is not supposed to do that to you .
[A] That 's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way , you know , down the hallway .
-----
[A] Do you do anything on a regular basis ?
[B] Well , off and on ,
[B] off and on .
[B] Right now I 've been off
[B] but , I 've been going over to the fitness center .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's a good ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] I ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] three times ,
[A] My husband 's a T I -er in the MUMBLEx unit here .
[B] Well I try to go over there at least three times a week ,
-----
[B] and I try to walk , um , at least five times a week .
[A] Do you , when you go to the MUMBLEx ,
[A] I have to ask you ,
[A] and if this is getting to MUMBLEx ,
[A] we 're not supposed to get too particular ,
[A] but I 'm just curious ,
[A] when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged , either at the Dallas location or the Spring Creek , in terms of , there 's so much , it 's so much of a weight orientation , weight lifting , et cetera .
-----
[B] Yeah .
[B] Uh , well , I 've been going to Spring Creek .
[B] I have n't been to the Dallas one now in , oh , a couple of years .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] At least since they 've redone it , supposedly redone .
[B] So I do n't really ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it- , well , it 's not that great ,
-----
[A] and I go to the Spring Creek one on and off .
[A] But my husband 's working over there
[A] and he just goes to the Dallas one .
[A] But I just do n't ,
[A] I mean , it 's just so much weight lifting .
[A] Even the Spring Creek one has a lot of weights in it .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's true .
[A] Or is that what you 're into
-----
[A] or ,
[B] No ,
[B] No ,
[B] well , I 've used the Nautilus equipment .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And the bikes , and stair climbers , and stuff like that mostly .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I do n't use the free weights
[B] but ,
[A] I like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I like those too .
[A] And the pool when it gets warmer .
-----
[B] And the pool ,
[B] yeah .
[B] That 's great .
[A] Yeah .
[B] 
[A] I know .
[A] Well , what I did was I went to a jazzercise class in a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas ,
[A] and long story short , I had n't ,
[A] this is really a stupid thing that happened ,
[A] but they have like the gymnasium flooring
[A] and then like they had about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where I usually stand --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- in any class like that I go to .
[A] Instead of having that level , you know --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- they had a chrome strip that was n't level ,
[A] and it was about four inches deep and then about , oh a seventy degree angle .
[B] Oh , my goodness .
-----
[A] And as we were jumping around or doing something I just jumped up and came right down on it .
[B] Um .
[A] The orthopedist called it a , uh , basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you , and it snapped .
[B] Woo .
[A] I know .
[A] We went to MUMBLEx , well whatever in Plano ,
[A] and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show .
[A] And the doctor said , you did n't do anything .
[A] There 's only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you .
[A] That was Tuesday night ,
[A] and Wednesday night the radiologist called me at work
[A] and , uh , I was on crutches ,
[A] and he said , I think you better call an orthopedist .
[A] So we went to one
[A] and he just put a big old cast on it .
[B] Put a big cast on it .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] for about four weeks .
-----
[B] Four weeks ,
[B] yeah .
[A] Well , I like aerobics ,
[A] but I 'm not so sure that ,
[B] Well not that much , though .
-----
[A] No ,
[A] I 've never ,
[A] I was off for about six months too just for some other surgery I 'd had ,
[A] but I 've never , I 'd , you know , I was pretty much in shape walking
[A] and , and , you know , this is one of those things ,
[A] like this orthopedist said , he said you 'd be surprised how many basket- , how many people come in here with things like that because they are active .
[B] Yeah .
[A] You know , I was real embarrassed ,
[A] but I felt kind of stupid .
[B] . Well , those things happen , though .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] they do .
[A] I mean , I guess I 'm glad , you know , that , um , nobody really noticed ,
[A] I guess you could say .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Because I got up and started jumping on it again .
[B] Well that did a lot of good ,
[B] I 'm sure .
[A] Yeah
[A] really .
[A] I enjoy aerobics ,
-----
[A] and I do it because I like it ,
[A] I mean , I like the music and --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- that kind of stuff .
[B] I like the music ,
-----
[B] but I 've been unable to do that , because I hurt my foot about five years ago .
[B] I broke my heel .
[A] Oh --
[A] -- that makes my foot ,
-----
[A] how 'd you do that ?
[A] In aerobics ?
[B] No ,
[B] no ,
[B] actually I was up on a ladder , and , uh , fell off .
-----
[A] Oh goodness .
[B] Leaned the wrong way .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And when I came down I hit with my full weight on my foot , but on concrete .
[A] What 'd they do for that ?
-----
[A] Did they have to cast it ?
[B] Yeah ,
[B] they had , well they had to go in and do surgery .
[B] They put a pin in it .
-----
[A] Oh , so the aerobics , the impact , would not be good .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] as I permanently damaged the , the cushion under my heel --
[A] Oh , goodness .
-----
[B] -- the normal cushion that you have there .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I ca n't do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt .
[A] Oh , that makes sense .
[A] So , I mean , are you , in terms of other things , like , like , not running , but playing a little bit of tennis , or can you not do stuff like that at all ?
-----
[B] Uh , well I have n't tried that .
[B] I do n't know .
[B] It 's been I bet it 's been thirty years since I played tennis .
[A] Yeah .
[A] It 's been ,
-----
[B] Mostly into just walking and stuff like that .
[A] That 's probably the safer way
[A] because I notice in aerobics a lot of the women that do n't look like they should n't be doing certain things --
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- I 'm always afraid they 're going to fall over and have a coro , coronary .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And there was my ego when I went ahead
[A] and I went , oh , I can do that
[A] and --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- half the time though I do n't jump half as much as ,
[A] I mean , like , I 'm real tall ,
[A] and , you know , I 'm not heavy ,
[A] but when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height , um , I 'm five eleven --
[B] Um .
[A] -- you need just take it easy .
[B] Sure .
[A] Um , but when I see some wo- ,
[A] I mean , and I just do n't think it 's healthy
[A] all that pounding all the time .
[B] It is n't , really , it 's not really good for your knees .
-----
[A] So , yeah ,
[A] that 's the other reason ,
[A] and , I do n't know ,
[A] this was just , I guess , something freak that happened to me ,
[A] because I was n't familiar with the ,
[B] Well , the floor was uneven .
[A] Oh , it was completely ,
[A] I mean , it literally ,
[A] the two dissimilar floor lev- , floor coverings were not level .
-----
[A] And at first after it happened I thought , maybe that 's a handicap access ,
[A] and then I said no ,
[A] that 's just the way it 's constructed .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And my husband being a T I engineer ,
[A] I said a few things to him when I got home ,
[A] I said , who has engineered that ? .
[B] Really .
[A] But I ,
[A] sounds you , like
[A] one thing that I like , like swimming , you like that a lot ?
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] I like swimming .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] do you like to exercise because you want to or because you have to ?
-----
[B] No ,
[B] I like , I liked it because I want to ,
[B] it makes me feel better .
[A] That 's how I am .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[A] If I do n't do it I just feel like I do n't have as much energy .
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] And it 's real funny because if you , you know ,
[B] it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that you 'd be tired ,
[B] but it 's the other way around .
[A] Right .
[A] It curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff .
[B] Yeah
[B] really .
[A] Yeah
[A] but ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] and I need all the help I can get .
[A] That gravity factor ,
-----
[A] I know .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] It does get you .
[A] Like that orthopedist said to me , he said , do n't worry Diane ,
[A] he says , he said , uh , you 're at thirty something ,
[A] but you 're on the upper side .
-----
[A] He said that , do n't worry ,
[A] he says , even if you were n't doing anything your body would start , that would start to happen to you .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] thanks a lot .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] because I was saying to him , I said , I 'm not that heavy ,
[A] I 'm not heavy , you know ,
[A] maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I said , uh , why do I feel like I need to start pushing myself more .
[A] And he goes , human nature .
-----
[A] And then , you know , you see these little girls in these little bitty things ,
[A] and they 're all like twenty-one years of age .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] But luckily at MUMBLEx there 's a little more diverse clientele .
[B] That 's true ,
-----
[B] they do .
[A] Except for the guys that lift the weights .
[A] They do intimidate .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I try to go real late or real early before they get there .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[A] There some things I 'd like to try ,
[A] but , you know , sometime when I ask , I just feel like , boy , am I stupid or what .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Well that 's one thing I like about the Spring Creek place .
-----
[B] At least the fellow that 's there , one of the fellows that 's there at night and on weekends is real helpful .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And his name is B J .
[A] I do n't think I 've ever , I think I 've ,
-----
[A] there was some girl there .
[A] I 've been there like , maybe a dozen times .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] But I actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] It 's terrible .
[A] I do n't know if the Dallas location ,
[A] it just seems that ,
[A] um , sometimes I feel like I 'm in a singles bar .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] that 's true .
[B] And I have n't noticed that up at Spring Creek .
-----
[A] No ,
[A] I have n't either ,
[A] and I just , uh ,
[A] it 's not that far of a drive
[A] and I 'm glad they did that .
[A] Um , you 're not missing anything at the Dallas renovated site .
[A] It 's not --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- at all anything worth talking about .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I thought maybe one of these days I 'll drive over there and check it out .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] but if you do n't live near there that 's not worth ,
[B] Yeah .
[B] I live in Richardson ,
[B] but it 's about half way between the Spring Creek and the , the Dallas site .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[A] That 's actually where this happened to me , out in , I say Plano ,
[A] but it 's all the same to me .
[A] Richardson , over on Campbell and Park Hill there 's a new recreation center .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And as we were doing it , too , everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities .
[A] MUMBLEx walked out ,
[A] I was one thing ,
[A] oh great , I have purple tights on , you know .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And they 're going yes .
[A] But in general I like to exer- , I , I like dance a lot ,
[A] so I mean aerobics is something I 'd hate to give up .
[A] But he , he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot ,
[A] but he just said to me , maybe you ought to try bicycling
[A] or ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] you probably will for a while , because it 's going to be real tender .
-----
[A] He told me eight to twelve weeks .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Not anything , you know .
[A] I said , but you 're only going to put the cast on for a couple of weeks .
[A] He said , yeah ,
[A] but that 's just ,
[A] they tried to put me in some kind of immobilized walker , because he does n't like to put casts on when it 's warm .
[A] But I just ,
[A] the more they tried to get my foot in the more I screamed ,
[A] I could n't , you know --
[B] I know what you mean .
-----
[A] -- adjust that .
[A] You know more about this stuff than I do , obviously then ,
[B] Not fun .
[A] No .
[A] Well , you 're walking okay now obviously ,
-----
[A] and you can ,
[B] Oh , yeah ,
[B] I have a slight limp from it ,
[B] but it matches one if I have one on the other side .
[A] MUMBLEx .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Well , anything else about exercise we can talk about .
-----
[B] Well , other than I need to go .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] me too ,
[A] me too .
[A] I need to go actually get something to eat here .
-----
[B] It 's great though ,
[B] I really do enjoy it .
[A] Okay ,
[A] thank you , Sandy .
[B] Sure ,
[B] thanks .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Bye-bye .
