[A] Do yo- , are you on a reg , regular exercise program right now ?
[B] Yes ,
[B] and I hate it .
[A] 
[B] How about you ?
[A] Oh , well , I 'm kind of off and on .
[B] Off and on
[B] well , I guess I 've been kind of off and on
[B] I 've , uh ,
[A] Right now I 'm kind of off .
[B] Had some health problems that have led me to , uh ,
[B] I 'd say more on than off .
[A] Okay ,
[A] what type of exercise do you do ?
[B] Uh , I do walking on the treadmill ,
[B] and then I do low impact aerobics .
[A] Okay .
[A] I guess you do n't enjoy that very much .
[B] Not , not really .
[A] Do you find that , uh , to be boring ?
[B] Yeah ,
[B] and time consuming ,
[B] I mean it 's not just the exercise that 's boring and time consuming ,
[B] it 's , uh , you know , afterwards , you know ,
[B] then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up , you know .
[A] Yeah .
[B] 
[A] Well , I 'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring .
[B] Oh , yeah .
[A] But I ,
[B] Do you go through this , is this something that you go through every year .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I have n't decided whether , whether I want to play yet or not
[A] I just bought myself a solo flex machine ,
[A] I do n't know if you 've seen those advertised on T V .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] It 's one of those , uh , universal type machines , exercise machines .
[A] But I have n't really sat down and used it match yet ,
[A] so it 's collecting dust right now .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] a lot of things do that .
[B] I had an ,
[A] I used to jog somewhat .
[B] I had an exercise bike
[B] I use to have one ,
[B] and I finally got rid of sit cause I never used it ,
[B] but I do use my treadmill .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] well , that 's good .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] my parents have a treadmill
[A] it 's ,
[A] when I go visit them , uh , I get on that thing every now and then .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it 's nice because when the weather 's bad you ca n't , you do n't have any excuse .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] I just got the bicycle out today ,
[A] and it was real nice outside ,
[A] had to get out to do something .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I ca n't ride a bike
[B] so .
[A] I 've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold
[A] so thought I ,
[B] Oh .
[A] better , better get outside and do something and not waist the day .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it 's too nice ,
[B] it 's been too nice all weekend .
[A] But , uh , yeah ,
[A] I need to start jog something again .
[A] I 've always of that to be , uh , really one of the best forms of exercise ,
[A] but it 's terribly boring ,
[A] and so I really do n't ever keep a program up consistently .
[B] Have you ever had any injuries from jogging ?
[A] No ,
[A] I never have .
[A] Well , I do n't job enough I think to develop any injuries
[A] I usually only go about a mile or two .
[B] I guess it worries me about jogging it 's that I hear that it 's very hard on your body and , and that , you know , you can end up getting hurt ,
[A] Yeah ,
[B] worse .
[A] it 's , it 's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] or on asphalt .
[A] Suppose to be much better if you find grass , uh , or , or dirt to jog on .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's not quite so ,
[A] You have to have the right ,
[B] so easy .
[A] type of shoes too ,
[A] that 's ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] very important .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I found that ,
[A] But ,
[B] true especially from walking on toe and fronts .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I do n't have to buy jogging shoes all to often
[A] my do n't get very much use .
[B] Well , I guess my breakdown about , they say about every six months .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] I usually enjoy the exercise I do
[A] but , uh , like I said I 'm just not very consistent about maintaining a , a program .
[A] So I 'll , I 'll bicycle
[A] I get into that for , for a little while and maybe go out , uh , on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile ,
[A] but then I 'll get tired of doing that ,
[B] 
[A] and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week .
[B] MUMBLEx .
[A] But , uh , that gets old too in a very short order ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] I 'm , I 'm hoping that this , uh , solo flex will , uh , uh , change things a little bit ,
[A] I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] well , do n't let it collect dust .
[B] At least exercise while dusting it off .
[A] Yeah .
[B] well .
[A] Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can , uh , start some type of , uh , regular program .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that , that 'll be good .
[A] I 've always found that , uh , when you write things down and set goals it 's a lot easier to keep , uh , keep something going .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Uh , when I was in high school we had a choice of , uh , taking , uh , physical education courses on exercise ,
[A] an , uh , one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine , lifting weights and ,
[B] Oh .
[A] uh , working out like that .
[A] And that was very helpful
[A] we kept charts of our progress ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and , uh , consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks .
[A] I found that to be , uh , very helpful .
[B] Are you going to do that ?
[A] Uh , I need to ,
[B] 
[A] I have n't started yet
[A] but , uh , it 's a thought .
[B] Well , that sounds like something good to do then .
[A] Sounds like something I should do .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] nice way to start off this spring .
[A] 
[B] Get back in shape .
[A] How often do you , uh , uh , go out each week on your walking ?
[B] Well , I do ,
[B] I switch every other day
[B] one day I walk
[B] and one day I do the aerobics .
[A] Okay ,
[A] how far , about how far do you go walking ?
[B] Well , I 'm trying to get my tolerance now
[B] I just had surgery , um , less then two months ago ,
[B] and right now I 'm just a little over about a mile and a half ,
[A] Okay .
[B] but I 'm trying to workup to three miles .
[A] Well , that 's good .
[A] Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging .
[B] Yeah ,
[A] It ,
[B] it takes , it 's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect .
[A] Sure .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] but .
[A] Well , if you keep up with a consistent pace just to , uh , keep the heart rating going , uh ,
[B] My walkman broke ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] so I 'm upset ,
[A] 
[B] and I just have to turn to stereo up real loud .
[A] Yeah .
[B] 
[A] But it 's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it is
[B] and this does n't , you know ,
[B] my treadmill has an incline
[B] and , you know , you can get a really good workout on it .
[A] Um , do you go to an aerobics class
[A] or do you watch ,
[B] No ,
[B] I ,
[A] on T V ?
[B] I just do it on T V ,
[A] Okay .
[B] I have a cassette .
[A] Which , uh , shows do you watch on T V ?
[B] Um , it 's a , it 's a tap- ,
[B] I use tapes .
[A] Oh , okay ,
[A] okay ,
[A] like a Cathy Smith workout ,
[B] Or , or Richard Simmons ,
[A] or Jane Fonda .
[B] 
[A] Okay .
[B] Sweating to the oldies .
[A] Right .
[A] I , ev- , every now and then I 'll watch E S P N ,
[A] I get cable on T V ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and they have , uh , a couple of shows called basic training ,
[A] and , uh , what is the other one called .
[B] There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N ,
[B] I do n't know if he 's still on any more or not ,
[B] I don- , I do n't know if I get E S P N or not .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But , uh , one , you know ,
[B] I use to watch one , watch one on the air ,
[B] but that was back ,
[A] BODIES IN MOTION that 's , that 's the name of the one I was thinking of .
[B] That 's was ,
[B] yeah .
[A] With Gill .
[B] Yeah .
[A] MUMBLEx .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I watched that cause he was cute .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] he- , he- , he 's not bad
[A] his assistants usually are n't either .
[B] 
[A] 
[B] But , uh ,
[A] They 're always in , in Hawaii some place .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] On , on the beach .
[B] But then that was back when , uh , you know , the high impact and ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well , they , they do low I pact stuff now ,
[B] Do they .
[B] Are the- ,
[B] yeah
[B] they 're still , they 're still , he 's still doing it then , uh .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] every morning .
[B] I 'll have to tune in .
[A] It 's on E S P N , uh ,
[A] at what time ,
[A] I ca n't remember what time .
[A] It 's , uh , you know ,
[A] I ca n't remember offhand what time .
[B] I 'll have to check it , check ,
[A] Yeah
[A] MUMBLEx .
[B] check , check it back up ,
[B] and , but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show , at least on MUMBLEx .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] every now and then .
[B] Not everybody has a picture perfect body .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] well , I found that they , they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V .
[B] I have n't watch any other ones on T V .
[A] They 're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day .
[B] Just on some of the tapes .
[A] Monday through Friday incase you 're interested in that .
[B] Okay ,
[B] thanks .
[A] but ,
[B] Now , that 's a thought .
[A] uh , I have n't done so much as , uh , watch the tape that I made .
[B] 
[A] So I 'm kind of bad about that myself .
[B] Well , that 's thought ,
[B] I have n't thought about that ,
[B] well they 're going to beep us pretty soon .
