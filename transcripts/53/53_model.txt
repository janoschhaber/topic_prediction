[A] Well , I , I do n't think that it 's , it 's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions .
-----
[A] For instance , jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there 's , where there 's , uh , endangerment to their own life and other people 's lives .
[B] Uh , I agree with that .
[B] People that are , uh , driving --
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- like , uh , truck drivers and things like that .
[B] I definitely think they should be tested .
[B] And I 'm not , I 'm not opposed to any testing .
[B] I mean because I know I certainly would n't want to , to , uh , you know , be endangered by somebody in a company that accidentally dropped something on me or , or you know , because he was on drugs while he was there .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Uh ...
[A] Well , how do you , how do you feel about , uh , companies drug testing prior to hiring ?
-----
[B] Oh , uh , I was tested , uh , within my company .
[B] I think it 's kind of a push to , uh , weed out drugs in states
[B] and , because I do n't know of any other countries that are doing this --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and I , I feel like it 's really just within the United States .
[B] It 's , uh , it 's okay .
[B] I think your record should stand for itself . That , you know , if you 've been tested at other companies and you 've always come up negative or whatever , then I do n't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- of testing you over and over and over .
[B] And once you 've established the fact that you 're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you 're not . I think they could , uh , save money by not doing that . You know , every time ,
[B] say if you change jobs you would n't have to do it if you 'd just been tested at your other work place .
[A] Well , what about random testing , though .
[B] Oh .
[A] Do you feel like that 's an in- , invasion of certain people 's rights if not everyone is tested ?
[B] Uh , not if it 's done fairly .
-----
[B] And that 's probably my question is , how , how do you know it 's done fairly .
[A] I do n't know that you do .
[A] If it 's random , then it 's random --
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- and that 's not necessarily fair .
[B] Well , they might tell you it 's random .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But then , you know , it 's kind of like a , a lottery .
[B] Somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person does n't win anything , and tries and tries and tries .
[A] Yeah .
[B] You know .
[A] Well , I ha- , I know that , for instance , in the N C double A , they drug test
-----
[A] and it 's not random .
[B] Oh , I see .
[B] How 'd , how did they , how do they pick their people ?
-----
[A] Uh , well , I think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and from that point on , uh , at , the N C double A does have something to do with it ,
[A] but it 's almost discretionary on the coach 's part of each in , individu , individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem .
[B] Oh , I see .
[B] So , do you ...
[A] And , and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time .
[B] Right .
[B] Well , do you think that should be implemented in the work place . You know , as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs ,
-----
[B] do you think they should have the right to send them --
[A] Well , not being a --
[B] -- to be tested .
[A] -- drug user I do n't have a problem with that personally --
[B] Right .
[A] -- but I think that might be a violation of someone 's rights .
[A] If someone 's having personal problems for some reason that 's causing them to h- , behave differently --
-----
[B] Right .
[A] -- and their manager assumes they have a drug problem --
[A] -- I mean if someone assumed that of me , I would be upset .
[B] Right ,
[B] right .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it , it would almost be like a , a , uh ...
-----
[A] It 's an accusation ,
[A] and , and it 's --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and it 's based on , on a perception that someone has as how a drug user would behave when some drug users behave , uh , normal , uh , you know .
[B] And then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and , you know , your supervisor has accused you of using drugs .
[A] Right ,
[A] exactly .
[A] I , I do n't ,
[A] the , I think almost the only way that drug testing can be done fairly is if it 's across the board from , from the janitors to the executive management .
-----
[B] Right .
[B] I agree with that .
[B] Because I know personally myself , I 've been in the same job for three years ,
[B] it will be three years in August
[B] and I 've already been drug tested three times .
[A] What type of job do you have ?
-----
[B] Well , I 'm an environmental engineer --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and I 've been drug tested three times
[B] and I know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime
[B] and the company I work for is sixty thousand people , plus .
[B] So see I , for some reason , I 've come up three times .
[B] That 's pretty high statistics .
[A] Well , does your r- , does your job require you to drive company equipment or to ap- , operate any type of machinery that might --
[B] No .
[A] -- endanger someone ?
[B] No ,
[B] not at all .
[A] Well , that does n't ,
-----
[A] I mean I ...
[B] It 's a legal job , you know --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- so , see it 's really strange .
[A] That is odd .
[A] I was drug tested , uh , not for the job I have now , but for the prior job , uh ,
-----
[A] but I know that they sent , that the job I had before , that , well ,
[A] the job I have , have now , requested my , uh , uh , my , uh , medical record from my old company --
[B] Oh , uh-huh .
-----
[A] -- so I do n't know if I was n't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me did n't request the drug test , because I know that my company does drug testing on occasion .
[B] Right .
[B] Well , does your , the company say , for instance , does the company you worked for bef- , before have the right or do they have the ability to say , hey , we 've already drug tested her
[B] and she came up negative .
[A] Well , no ,
-----
[A] I do n't think they can , they can force another company to not drug test me just by saying that I , I --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- did n't , I mean ,
[A] they do n't know that I do n't use drugs .
[A] They just tested me once .
[B] Right ,
[B] right .
[A] But , I used to work for a power company ,
[A] so it was very important that they make sure their employees , especially linemen --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- uh , were clean .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And since I was just , you know , one of the office folk , I guess it was n't as important to them that they test me regularly .
[A] But I know they test most of the service people fairly regularly --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- reg- , uh , just across the board .
[B] Yeah .
[B] And are they tested random ?
[A] No ,
[A] they 're ,
-----
[A] all of them are tested --
[B] They 're ...
[A] -- once every three mo- ,
[A] it 's a rotation .
-----
[B] Oh , okay .
[B] I see .
[A] But it ,
[A] but again , it depends on what job you 're in .
[B] Yeah .
[A] The men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot
[A] and the men that drive the trucks --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- with , with the guys that fix the power lines are n't tested as much .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] But , but see , they make that clear to them as they hire those guys --
[B] Oh , I see .
[A] -- what , what the drug testing schedule is .
[A] They say we , we 're testing you tomorrow
[A] and we 'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Okay ,
[B] so they know that .
[B] And that 's ...
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it 's , it 's made very clear upon hiring .
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Okay .
[B] Well ...
[A] Well , have we spent our at least five minutes ?
[B] Yeah --
[A] Okay .
[B] -- I think so .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] seven twenty-five .
-----
[A] Okay .
[B] Okay ,
[B] nice speaking to you .
[A] Nice talking to you .
[A] Bye-bye
[B] Bye .
