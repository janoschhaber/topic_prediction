[A] Cindy , have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES ?
[B] No ,
[B] I have n't .
[B] Have you ?
[A] Oh , that is a wonderful movie .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] it 's not ,
[B] the length is n't too long ?
[A] No .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Oh goodness no .
[A] You do n't even , you do n't even realize it , you know .
[B] Well , we all heard different opinions about it .
[B] Uh ,
[A] Really .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] one that , you know ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] it was too long
[B] and they thought that , you know , at certain points that it was going to end ,
[B] and it did n't ,
[B] and it kept going on
[B] and ,
[B] uh-huh .
[A] Oh , I thought it was great .
-----
[B] Really .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Now , I 've seen , you know , some different clips of it , um ,
[B] and it , it looks good ,
[B] it 's just I have n't had the time to go to the movies lately .
[A] Well , yeah ,
[A] and I heard a story about there 's a , there 's a certain scene in the movie where there 's , um , where they 're , they 're on a buffalo hunt .
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] And they have a particular child actor , uh , who 's , who 's being supposedly run down by a buffalo .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And when they were trying to film that , the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Young 's buffalo .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I ca n't remember what they said his name was .
[A] But he has a fetish for Oreo cookies .
[B] Uh-huh ,
-----
[B] oh ,
[A] And he got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with oreo cookies .
[B] Hey ,
[B] that 'd work for me ,
[B] let me tell you .
[A] I thought that was really funny .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] uh-huh .
[B] Now I 've seen another clip of , um , the guy that plays in MURPHY BROWN ,
[B] I do n't know his name ,
[B] but he played the , uh , the , the character in it that was very , like , gross , I mean , very dirty ,
[B] an ,
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] Oh , I saw the one clip of him
[B] and ugh ,
[B] it was first ,
[B] I guess he was taking Kevin Costner to like the site where he was going to be or whatever .
[A] Oh , yeah .
-----
[B] That was rather , um , gross .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] the wagon , the wagon driver .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[B] But other than that I 've heard the , the , you know , the , um , the scenery in it --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- is absolutely beautiful .
[A] And , uh , the costuming --
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] really .
[A] -- yeah , was ,
[A] the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it did n't , that , that , um , the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things .
[B] Oh really .
-----
[A] And they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- probably --
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] uh-huh .
[A] -- to age , to age the material
[A] so , they , they did very authentic reproductions of the ,
[B] The styles ,
-----
[B] uh-huh .
[A] of the actual stuff ,
[A] but they did n't , they did n't age it --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- quite enough it seemed .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] But it was a very good movie .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Well , I guess I will have to see it then .
[A] What have you seen lately ?
[B] Um , actually have been to the movies , um ,
[B] I think the last movie I saw was MISERY .
[A] Oh , I did n't see that .
[B] Oh , very suspenseful .
[A] I do n't , I do n't like Stephen King .
[B] I really do n't either ,
[B] but I went with someone ,
[B] and once I was there , I could n't believe .
[B] I mean , it 's an excellent movie .
[A] Really .
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] I was n't sure ,
[A] because , uh , just generally , you know , that kind of scary stuff I , I just do n't want to have anything to do with it .
[B] It 's not necessarily , it 's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful .
[B] I mean it 's not .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I think I heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something , you know .
[B] No ,
-----
[B] in , in the book apparently she cuts his feet off ,
[B] but in the movie she , she disables him , but not by cutting his feet .
[A] Um .
[B] Um , she , she breaks both of his ankles .
[A] Ugh .
[B] And that I could n't watch ,
[B] and , but , you know , you could tell when it was coming .
[A] Yeah .
[B] So yeah , um ,
[B] that was so that he could n't leave her ,
[B] cause she ,
[A] It still just seems a little twisted to me .
[B] Yeah ,
-----
[B] yeah
[A] I 'm not sure I would have enjoyed that at all .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] well , as far as that goes ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] I mean , you would n't like to see anybo- , anything happen to anybody ,
[B] but it was just how she got so caught up ,
[B] her emotions --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and , you know , and , and she feel madly in love with this writer .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And there was this ,
-----
[B] but she was a killer ,
[B] and the , the character was , you know , prior to that had , had been someone that had killed other people --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- but no one knew that .
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] So . But .
[B] So , yeah ,
[B] we just have n't had the time to go to the movies lately ,
[A] I know ,
[A] we do n't see movies at the movies a lot .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] The last ,
[A] we did go see DANCES WITH WOLVES
[A] and we went to see NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER ,
[A] but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape ,
[A] and then we rent them .
[B] Right ,
[B] right .
[B] Now I want to see SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY .
[A] Oh , yeah --
[A] -- that looks really good too .
[B] -- yeah ,
[B] that looks good .
[B] And there were a couple others that I just have n't had the time .
[A] And SILENCE OF THE LAMBS .
[B] Now see I .
[A] I 'm , I 'm intrigued by it ,
[A] but I 'm not sure I want to go see it yet .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I do n't think I want to see that either .
[B] I know ,
[B] I do n't think I could .
[A] I think , uh ,
[A] well , now , we had some friends that went to see it
[A] and they said it was okay .
[B] Really .
[A] So , it might not be as ,
[A] I think they may be playing up --
[B] Really .
[A] -- um , some aspects of the movie that are n't the main aspects .
[B] Uh-huh
[B] MUMBLEx .
[A] Now , we went to see the JAGGED EDGE .
[B] Oh , I liked that movie .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So , it 's , it seems like , you know , that kind of --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- the thriller suspense and not , not real , um , strange in other ways .
[B] Uh-huh , um .
[B] Well , I guess that 's about it .
[B] It was nice .
[A] Okay .
[A] Maybe we 'll talk to you again .
[B] Okay ,
[B] it was nice talking to you .
[A] Alright .
[B] Bye-bye .
[A] Bye-bye .
