[A] Where do you get most of your news ?
[B] I watch the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour ,
[B] and I subscribe to the paper on the weekends .
[A] Where , where are you ?
[B] I 'm in Dallas .
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] Are you in Dallas also ?
[A] No ,
[A] I 'm in San Antonio .
[B] Oh , really ,
[B] okay .
[A] I get my news from a combination of sources .
[A] I take the paper every day --
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] -- and I read it on the way in to work on the , in a carpool .
[B] Oh , really .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] And , uh , and I watch the , uh , actually I watch the morning news before I leave for work .
[A] And then , you know , usually over lunch , there 'll be a big topic of conversation on something --
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] -- from the news .
[B] I normally find that uh , I- , I 'm probably the most , um , news hungry of my friends ,
[B] so I do n't , we do n't normally talk about the news at lunch .
[B] I , I find that I have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend , simply because I used to get it during the week --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- but , um , I would always end up arriving at work late , because I would always end up skimming the headlines , spending too much time ,
[B] reading it in the morning .
[A] Yeah .
[B] So I have to cut myself down to the weekend , plus after work .
[B] Um , the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour is on public television --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and I enjoy that quite a bit .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Um , one of the women that I work with , her husband is Iranian .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we 've had some very interesting conversations over lunch .
[B] I will admit I work with , uh , someone who 's Iranian ,
[B] and he definitely has a very different slant on the news .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] He 's very , very skeptical of the news media ,
[B] and I will admit I 'm reasonably skeptical also .
[B] But he 's , I do n't know , uh , he 's mu- , much , much more so .
[B] It 's sort of interesting though , because he does bring a , a much , um , different perspective with all the Gulf goings on , um .
[B] He was always speaking in terms of , you know , American imperialism reasserting itself .
[B] Um , I suppose it 's a different attitude that we normally do n't hear in the country .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Well I , I , uh , I like the print news --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- much better than the television news because television news tends to sensationalize .
[B] True , um ,
[B] the ,
[A] I understand that the MacNeil Lehrer probably does n't .
[B] They , um , tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] They will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time .
[B] Sort of like the , uh , what is that , A B C 's NIGHTLINE .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Well , I guess they only normally stick with just the one , um , story .
[B] But they , they can do a much better job since they do n't have to chop it into little two minute stories .
[A] They do n't report on every murder and shooting that happened in , in every little town .
[B] No ,
[B] no .
[B] It 's very much national interest news .
[A] Yeah .
[B] A lot of times they end up , um , with these panels of experts
[B] and they go back and forth , where everyone 's giving some opinions
[B] and sometimes that ,
[B] I do n't know the value of that , because I saw plenty of jokes and , and , um , oh , editorial cartoons about all the retired generals ,
[B] making a living during the , the Gulf War .
[A] I 've been getting a kick out of those lately .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Although , um .
[A] I- , I 'm only twenty-five ,
[A] so I 've never actually been through a period of war --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and I do n't know anyone in the military
[A] and I do n't have a lot of background knowledge in , uh , military strategy and , and weaponry , and , and all that kind of stuff .
[A] And I thought the generals were very interesting .
[A] Now when they started to speculate , I , I saw that for what is was ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and thought all of these guys do n't know what 's going on .
[A] But I thought the- , the- , they were interesting ,
[A] and , and they shed some light on what was going on for me .
[B] I will admit it 's interesting .
[B] I- , I- , I 'm twenty-six .
[B] So I do n't have any more experience in that than you .
[B] Um , it , it , it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind , you know ,
[B] there were some that were screaming for air power ,
[B] there were some that were saying the air power was n't going to do it .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world , which I suppose just about everyone does ,
[B] but these guys had a , a , uh , national soap box to stand on and , and express this view .
[A] You know , one of the best television news shows that I saw during the war was a show on a Saturday morning on A B C ,
[A] and it was for children --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and it was hosted by Peter Jennings ,
[A] and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio ,
[A] and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions .
[A] And they , they had all their correspondents in the different areas , in Saudi Arabia , and Israel , and , and all .
[A] They had them all , uh , on ,
[A] I do n't know what you 'd call it other than on line .
[A] They had them all on hold --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and if a child asked a question that the person in Jerusalem could best answer , they would cut to that person ,
[A] and that person would answer the question .
[A] It was just very informative and interesting ,
[A] and , uh , I was real impressed at how A B C handled , uh , translating ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] the war for children .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I did n't see anything like that , although I did , uh ,
[B] I guess one thing that I found sort of interesting ,
[B] this is getting a little off the topic ,
[B] but there was a , a , a big push with the local T V stations to have little hot lines with counselors --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- to , to help parents learn how to talk about their war with their children .
[B] I thought that was a really unusual thing .
[A] And our local H E B stores here ,
[A] I do n't know if it 's H E B statewide or whatever ,
[A] but they have videos that , uh ,
[A] I do n't know if they still have them ,
[A] but they were free rental ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] videos , that had something to do with the war .
[B] Ju- , --
[A] Uh , it was ,
[B] -- It- , with the children 's aspect ?
[A] Right .
[A] It was something for children , that they , they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and , uh , getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and that kind of thing .
[B] I suppose that is a valuable service .
[B] Again not having , uh , lived through another war , I do n't know if that 's a common thing that people thought of ,
[B] or if that was --
[A] Well --
[B] -- a new concern with people .
[A] -- back during the Viet Nam conflict that no one will , will have the guts enough to call a real war --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- uh , the , that type of technology just was n't at people 's disposal .
[B] That 's true .
[B] That 's true .
[A] So I do n't think there 's ever been a war that 's been so thoroughly covered by the news .
[B] And probably more importantly , one that lasted short enough that , that people 's interest did n't flag too badly .
[A] Yeah .
[A] I tell you what ,
[A] the first three days , I was glued to the television .
[B] I will admit the same thing .
[B] And I ,
[A] And I ,
[B] would come home and flip on MacNeil Lehrer
[B] and they would run these extended two , three hour versions of the program --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and I , I was just , I was horrified and fascinated by what I was seeing .
[A] I tell you what .
[A] The uh , the war start- ,
[A] let 's see , was it a Wednesday or Thursday ?
[A] Must have been Thursday , uh ,
[A] and Friday night I was , I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning , sitting , right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Because I was watching C N N ,
[A] and they would , they would switch back to one of their Israel bureaus ,
[A] and the people would be standing there in gas masks ,
[A] and you 'd be hearing the sirens ,
[A] and it was just ,
[A] I was amazed .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] I , I did n't have that experience .
[B] I , I do n't have cable --
[A] Oh .
[B] -- so I , I 'm pretty much limited to P B S , which I thought , I thought they did a very good job .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Um , I 've got one question for you .
[B] I you say you take the newspaper .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Um , I , I found the newspaper situation in Dallas very interesting .
[B] We 've got the one fairly , well , relatively weaker paper , the TIMES HERALD , and then the MORNING NEWS , which has a very strong subscription .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Does San Antonio ha ,
[B] you said San Antonio , right ?
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Do you have just one paper ,
[B] or do you have several ?
[A] No .
[A] There are two ,
[A] and they 're pretty close .
[A] Uh , the one that I picked is more similar in format to the newspaper ,
[A] I grew up near Houston --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck ,
[A] and the one I picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as I was growing up . I mean , the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] It 's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over ,
[A] and I enjoy ,
[A] the comics are better in this newspaper .
[A] This newspaper has the far side and the comics that I enjoy
[A] and the other one has some weird ones that I 've never heard of .
[A] So ,
[B] I , I actually take both newspapers on the weekends .
[A] Do you ?
[B] I figure I 'm only taking on the weekend ,
[B] and I can afford that .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I , I find the news reporting in the MORNING NEWS to be better ,
[B] but I sort of have a liberal political slant ,
[B] and the MORNING NEWS just has an incredibly conservative editorial , um , outlook .
[A] And my ,
[B] I get the TIMES HERALD just to balance that out a little bit .
[A] My fiancee takes probably six Sunday papers .
[A] He takes both San Antonio papers , an Austin paper , both Houston papers ,
[A] I guess he takes seven , the San Marcos paper and the New Braunsfel paper ,
[A] but he 's a football coach at Southwest Texas State University ,
[A] so he 's getting all the sports sections .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , so , you know , he has these stacks of Sunday newspapers that go unread ...
