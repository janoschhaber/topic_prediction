[B] Okay , uh ,
-----
[B] my favorite show is MASTERPIECE THEATRE
[B] and it has been for a long time
[B] but I feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because I have never met anybody who likes it .
[B] Do you by any chance ?
[A] Oh , yes .
[B] You do !
-----
[A] Yes ,
[A] very much .
[B] Well , would n't you know .
[A] As a matter of fact , I prefer public television .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , uh , I have , particularly enjoy the English comedies ,
[B] Yeah ,
[A] and the English mysteries .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I watch mysteries too .
[B] Is that what you 're referring to ?
-----
[A] Yes .
[B] Okay ,
[B] yeah .
[B] That is good .
[B] I like , uh ,
[B] do you read ?
[A] Vociferously .
[B] Okay ,
[B] well that 's the reason why I like both of those programs is because they 're kind of based on books .
[A] Yes .
[B] And , the plots are more , um , challenging , you know , than the sitcoms of regular T V .
[A] Well , unfortunately for us at least here in the United States , we , the only access we have to that of course is public television .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I 'm , I 'm not a great television watcher in any respect
-----
[A] but , uh , the watching ,
[A] what I do watch is , uh , usually news and whatever is on public television .
[A] Any kind of ,
[A] I also uh , am very fond of great performances ,
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] yeah .
[A] in that regard .
[B] Me too .
[A] But , uh
-----
[B] Did you stay up late and catch this RED DWARF ?
[A] No ,
[B] Oh , that was a scream .
[A] no ,
[A] no
[A] as a matter of fact , uh , Turner Broadcasting ,
-----
[B] Uh-huh ,
[A] has been uh , broadcasting all of the James Bond movies ,
[B] Really .
[A] every night this week ,
[A] so I have concentrated on watching James Bond movies ,
[A] this week .
[B] I used to like him too ,
[B] he was my hero .
[B] In fact , I like Sean Connery to this day .
-----
[A] Well , they 're showing uh , LIVE AND LET DIE at this moment ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] and , it is the first appearance of Roger Moore as double oh seven .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So ,
[B] Oh , he can never cut it .
[A] No ,
[A] no
[A] that 's true .
-----
[A] I was just thinking that today , he did ,
[A] well , in some of the later movies he looks very effeminate ,
[B] Yeah ,
[A] in his early movies .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] he does .
-----
[A] Whereas , uh , Sean Connery has maintained the , uh , how would you , uh , ruddy look ,
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] yeah .
[B] I liked his accent too .
[B] And , he can even be in movies that are not , uh , uh , sexually oriented ,
-----
[B] and he still comes off great .
[A] Well , you know he was , when was it , last year or year before last , he was voted the sexiest actor in movies ,
[B] He is .
[A] or something .
-----
[B] Yeah ,
[B] he had my vote double .
[A] I mean the man is sixty-two years old .
[B] I do n't care .
[A] But , uh , but otherwise you know we ,
[A] uh , with P B S and so forth .
[A] And I ,
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] I particularly enjoy , I do n't know whether you 've had a chance to watch it on P B S but uh , the series , uh , YES MINISTER ?
[B] Oh , what 's that about ?
[A] That was about a , the Interior Minister ,
-----
[A] it was a comedy ,
[B] Oh , yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] the Interior Minister of , in England ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] with the permanent secretary ,
[B] Right .
[A] and bureaucracy and all that .
[B] Right ,
[B] I , I 've seen it several times .
-----
[B] It 's a scream ,
[B] but I have to go to bed ,
[B] I have to get up and , and work the next morning .
[B] I wish they 'd put those ,
[B] that 's why I say , did you stay up late to watch this RED DWARF .
[B] It came on after DOCTOR WHO ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] on Saturday nights , here at least .
[B] And it should ,
[B] of course I li-
[B] really it was ,
[B] I do n't think they should show it during prime time ,
[B] but still ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] it was funny .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I know .
[A] Well I , I , I 'm not much of a television watcher .
-----
[A] I , I read as I said ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and , uh , quite a bit .
[A] I read about two or three novels a week ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] in addition to all the technical stuff .
[A] What , what do you do ?
[A] What kind of work do you do ?
[B] I 'm a Payroll Clerk .
[B] Just an accounting clerk .
[A] At T I ?
-----
[B] No , uh ,
[B] I have a friend who works for T I
[B] and I work for a tire service ,
[A] Oh , I see .
[B] here in ,
-----
[B] I 'm from Dallas .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Well the last two people who have called , both worked for T I
[A] and I just wondered .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] it could be T I -ers , I think , probably are participating more than anybody else ,
[B] but I needed the money .
[B] This is five bucks here .
[A] I think that 's something we all ca ,
-----
[B] Yeah ,
[B] really .
[B] Do you work for T I ?
[A] No ,
[A] no ,
[A] I work for G T E .
[B] Really ?
[A] In Maryland ,
[A] yes .
[B] How did you hear ,
[B] oh we 're not even supposed to be talking about this though , are we ?
[A] I guess not .
[A] How did I hear about it ?
[A] Well I work , you know ,
[A] they are gathering a data base for voice processing .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , that 's my field of work also .
[B] Oh !
[A] So I , I know the people at T I who are doing this
[A] and I heard about it ,
[A] so I called them and asked if I could participate . And , uh ,
[B] Oh .
[A] You know send in the forms et cetera and uh so forth .
[B] Right .
[A] We could go back to television shows .
[B] Well , you know , speaking of public TV , have you caught any of this series on the Bible ?
[A] Yes ,
[A] I have .
[B] I 've heard that it 's really against the , well I mean that it 's coming out with the idea that the Bible 's not true .
[A] Well , no .
[A] That 's , uh ,
[A] you could interpret it that way .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Uh , I , I think what they are trying to say , is that there is a great deal of historical truth ,
[A] but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the Bible itself is probably uh , after the what , uh , was is it the King James Version when the committee did it , wrote the translation , that so much was lost in the translation , particularly since most of the translations were in Greek .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Well , for example . In Greek there are seven different words for love .
[B] Right .
[A] Okay ,
[A] so you can have ,
[A] there 's one word for love of your brother , one word for love of your wife , one word for , you know , uh , love of your father , and that sort of thing .
[A] So , in , as to those types of interpretations , uh , really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now , and what it 's at .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] So that 's , you know ,
[A] you can look at it as though they are saying it 's not true ,
[A] but there 's too much historical fact involved just from the uh , the histories that are , were developed around that time , that are available .
[B] Yeah .
[A] To deny that , at least the majority of it is true .
[A] So , you know , it depends on how you look at it .
[B] Yeah .
[A] You can look at it , you know ,
[A] if you want to say that it 's proven that it is n't true , then you can very much look at it that way .
[B] I guess if you 're looking for that , you 're ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well ,
[B] that , uh ,
-----
[A] Well , you can interpret that the , what the T V show , in the same way that you can interpret the Bible .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] So ,
[B] Really .
[A] But , uh , as , as far as that goes , I , we at least agree on what we enjoy .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's right .
-----
[A] But , uh , I do n't know if there is , there is a time limit on this ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] so , uh .
[B] Surely we 've made it .
-----
[A] I think so too .
[A] Let 's just ,
[A] it 's been very pleasant talking to you ,
[B] It was very nice talking to you .
-----
[A] and have a good evening .
[B] You too .
[A] Good night !
-----
[B] Bye-bye .
