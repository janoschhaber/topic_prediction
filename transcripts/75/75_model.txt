[A] Well , what would you have at a dinner party ?
-----
[B] Well , uh , lately , since I have children I 've cut down on having dinner parties .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] but when I do I try to keep it pretty simple on things that I can prepare ahead of time ,
[B] uh , I have one recipe for , uh , a really good , um , type of a meatball .
[B] It 's called burgundy meatball
[B] and it 's made with red wine and ,
[A] Oh , gosh ,
-----
[B] um --
[A] that sounds great .
[B] -- It 's , it 's really good
[B] and you can make it ahead of time and then , um , make the sauce when you 're ready to , um , to serve it .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] That 's one of my favorite things to , to serve .
[A] Well , um , I think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party .
-----
[B] Sure .
[A] But if it was informal , my first choice would be crawfish .
[B] Oh , really .
[B] Well , I guess being from that part of the country .
[A] Because , I mean , crawfish , everybody over here likes crawfish
[A] but --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- you know , I , I would n't have to worry about satisfying my guest .
[A] But if it was a formal dinner party I would probably think of something else like , uh ,
[A] shrimp , shrimp fettucini is real easy --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- to , um , make and everything
[A] and it 's usually well liked by people , I guess ,
[A] I 'm just a seafood fan
[A] so ,
[B] Well , how do ,
[A] I think on the lines of ,
[B] make , how do you , you cook crawfish ?
-----
[B] I , in fact , I just came back from the grocery store
[B] and being in Texas we do n't have too many , you know , people that , that eat crawfish
[B] but they had live crawfish ,
[A] Oh , yeah ,
-----
[B] on sale .
[A] um , you 're not supposed to , I mean , you 're not supposed to eat them dead .
[A] I mean ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] well , you eat them dead
[A] but ,
[B] Do n't buy them that way .
-----
[A] Right .
[A] Because if , if they are dead for too long ,
[A] you can always tell whenever they 're cooked if they 've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And you 're not supposed to eat those because they 're bad for you .
[B] Okay .
[B] Well , I 'll remember that .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] so if you ever go in a restaurant , order crawfish ,
[A] I mean , every once in a while you 'll see on- ,
-----
[A] I mean , it does n't happen very often because it 's just an accident
[A] but if the tail is straight on it then , yeah ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] do n't eat it .
[A] But , um , you just put some Cajun , well , lots of pepper --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and you just boil them
[A] and they 're absolutely wonderful
[A] but there 's , uh , they 're a pain to peel for some people .
[A] Once you get used to it they 're real easy
[A] but , um , you know , if you have nails or anything you can plan on those being shot .
[B] Huh . When you were , um , whe , when you serve it do you shell them and then serve em too ?
-----
[A] I think for a dinner party
[A] I , I do n't know
[A] it depends .
[B] Um-hum .
[A] Like if , like my age , if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party , no , I , they would shell their own ,
[B] Sure .
[A] you know , we 'd just have crawfish and beer or something
[A] but , um , if it was more formal like if I was , you know , working environment then I would probably , um , sh , shell 'em or at least disconnect them from the head .
[A] But there 's a ,
[B] Still have see that .
[A] There 's a , big thing over here that everybody sucks the head .
[A] So , um --
-----
[B] Ooh .
[A] -- it , it would just
[A] depend .
[A] That 's the best part of the crawfish .
[B] 
[A] Sucking the head
[A] But um I do n't know
[A] it jus- i- it just depends on what type it was I guess
[A] But you can buy uh the crawfish shells already peeled 'n everything
[A] And usually you use those like for frying
[B] Um-hum
[A] or to put in salads or to um You know make a sauce with or something like that
[A] But you can go ahead and buy 'em cooked and shelled
[A] and they 're more expensive of course
[A] but
[B] Does it taste a lot like shrimp
-----
[A] Um Yeah
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Just um The crawfish I mean it just has a taste of its own
[A] It also depends on who 's cooking it and how much seasoning they use
[B] Sure
[A] stuff like that
[A] but um I think that
[A] And also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party I think that that really helps
[B] Yeah .
[B] We have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks
-----
[A] 
[B] all the time
[B] And
[A] That 's what I need
[B] Yeah
[B] that 's what I wish I had
[B] but in our family I am the one who who cooks
[B] And I I really enjoy it
-----
[B] it 's gotten a little more difficult with kids
[B] But I really do enjoy cooking
[B] And we um we have them over for dinner
[A] Uh-huh
[B] back and forth quite a lot
[B] And before I had my second child we sort of had a contest going where
[A] 
[B] 
[A] Oh !
[B] you know he would cook and then the next time it would be my turn and I 'd try to outdo him
[A] 
[B] and then he 'd try to outdo
[A] 
[B] me
[B] and we we
[A] 
[B] was really a lot of fun
[A] I bet
[B] and
[A] that that got pretty competitive
[B] Yeah
[A] you know as
[B] it did
[A] far as
[B] we we
[A] who
[B] tried
[A] could come
[B] to
[A] up
[B] be
[A] with the best recipe
[B] fancier or more courses than the other
[A] That
[B] or
[A] would be fun
-----
[B] Uh it was a lot of fun you know
[B] it something unique you know
[B] and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food
[A] Uh huh
[B] Or um sometimes it would be um oh Oh I do n't know maybe an outdoor theme or uh elegant theme or you know
[B] It was a lot of fun
[A] Sometimes it might be the candlelight
-----
[A] and sometimes it might be the picnic out back
[B] That 's
[A] or something
[B] right
[A] Well
[B] 
[A] that 's you know that 's fun
[B] it was fun
-----
[B] and and we threatened to make the other two uh make us dinner one time
[A] Uh huh
[B] Uh Just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking
[B] and they were doing all the enjoying
[A] That sounds right I
[B] I 'm
[A] would I 'd take him up on that
[B] It does
[B] except that knowing them they would probably do something
[A] 
[B] ridiculous and terrible just
[A] 
[B] just to uh make sure that they did n't have to do it again
[A] Uh huh
[B] 
[A] I 'd
[B] make hot
[A] be
[B] dogs or
[A] 
[B] some potato chips
-----
[A] I that 's about how much I can cook
[B] 
[A] You know
[A] I 'm I 'm doing a lot more cooking now than I used to
[B] Uh-huh
[A] but that 's only because my mom just started working
[A] so she 's tired when she comes home in the afternoon
[A] so I try to have things cooked for her
[A] but
[B] Oh that 's nice
[A] uh um I usually try to stay out of kitchen
[A] I do n't know
-----
[B] 
[A] 
[B] 
[A] not one of my favorite hobbies
[B] It can it can be fun I if you have the time
[B] But you know a lot of times it 's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it
[A] Well um
[B] able
[A] my grandma speaking
-----
[B] to
[A] of those meatballs again she owned every Christmas and and Easter
[A] whenever we have at the big get-together over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce
[A] and it has
[A] I do n't know
[A] they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs
[A] and
[B] Uh-huh
[A] they are absolutely delicious
[A] I do n't know what she calls them in
[A] I do n't I 'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol
[A] But
[B] 
[A] um
[B] 
[A] I do n't know
[A] I would I would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around
[B] Yeah
[B] it 's um it 's in the other room
[B] I do n't know if we
[A] Oh
[B] have enough time for it
[B] it 's real easy
[B] one of the unique things in this it 's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um whatever seasonings
-----
[B] you can just light
[A] Yeah
[B] so salt and pepper Um and chopped up water chestnuts
[A] Oh
[B] which is something different um
[A] that would be wonderful
[B] makes them a little bit crunchy
-----
[B] you need to chop em up real fine
[A] Yeah
[B] But um it makes them crunchy
[B] and that adds something new to it
[B] And then the sauce is just made with um bouillion cubes
[A] Um-hum
[B] water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour
[A] Oh
[B] So it 's not a it 's not a thick rich type of a sauce
[B] it 's more of a
[B] when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have um Chinese food
[A] Um-hum
[B] And it gives it a bit of a different consistency
[A] Well um how long do you cook the meatballs
-----
[B] The meatballs you just um after you form them fry them in a pan until
[A] Uh huh
[B] they 're uh browned on all all sides
[B] and then drain off all the grease
[B] Uh then what I usually do is I freeze them
[B] And then when
[A] 
[B] you 're ready
[A] Oh
[B] to serve
[A] yeah
[B] them then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce And heat it
[B] probably you have to heat it up for a good oh
[B] if they 're frozen you know it may take a half for them to thaw out
[B] But then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself
[B] Let them simmer in the sauce itself
[A] Hum
[B] and it 's real good
[A] That sounds great
-----
[A] Especially I mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so so far in advance
[B] Right .
[A] I mean like if if
[B] And then freeze them
[A] you are having a dinner party on Wednesday night you could do it on a weekend
[B] Sure
[A] That would be great
-----
[A] I think I 'm going to have to keep that in mind for my future because I
[B] 
[A] hope to have to have lots of dinner parties
[A] Cause I like to
[A] I mean um Um I 'm sure that I 'll be involved in a big company
[A] and I know that my future husband will be You know
