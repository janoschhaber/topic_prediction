[A] So , do you have any hobbies ?
[B] Well , right at the present time nothing real special .
[B] I kind of like gardening
[B] and I 'm kind of into camping and , you know , vacationing , that sort of thing .
[A] Yeah , uh ,
[B] I do n't have any real serious ,
[A] I 'm an avid gardener , oh ,
[B] Oh , okay .
[B] I think you 're ,
[A] Um , I consider that a hobby .
[A] I do n't know ,
[A] they were like suggesting , like handcraft things which ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I guess that 's a really true , true hobby ,
[A] but I ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] I think anything that you enjoy ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] um , it does n't really have to matter ,
[A] I mean , it could be working on cars could be your hobby really .
[B] Really
[B] yeah ,
[B] I kind of enjoy doing that a little bit , too .
[B] No ,
[B] I , I guess if you make money at it , it becomes a vocation .
[A] well , I do n't know ,
[A] I told my husband , I said , you go out some to work on the car ,
[A] it 's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong .
[A] I says , you go pay to have someone do it .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something .
[B] I guess as far north as you are if you like gardening , you 've still got a couple months to go , have n't you ?
[A] Oh , yeah .
[A] Um , well , right now we , um , start our seeds inside .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Oh , yeah ,
[B] that 's right ,
[B] you would ,
[B] yeah .
[A] We 'll start them inside
[A] and , uh ,
[B] In cold frames or whatever the ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well , we usually start them right in the house .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] My sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck
[A] and , and the wi- , and a wind storm come and knock it down .
[B] Huh .
[A] But she 's had really good luck .
[A] I mean , i- , ca- ,
[A] next month ,
[A] well , actually , it , if you , if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside , pretty much the end of May ,
[A] you can leave them outside .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] You might put them in the ground just the first week of June --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of May .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I 've , I 've lived in , in Texas and New Mexico most of my life ,
[B] but I did once ,
[B] I spent one winter in North Dakota ,
[A] Oh .
[B] and I , I remember that it was on into May before it really started warming up ,
[B] and , uh ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well , well , we live , we live really close to Lake Champlain , which is in the Champlain Valley ,
[B] Oh , yeah .
[A] so we 're a little , we 're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts
[A] so ,
[B] Okay ,
[B] because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[A] We are a little lucky .
[A] Well ,
[B] You 're at ,
[A] my brother lives ten miles from here
[A] and he gets frost
[A] and ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] his crop gets killed .
[B] You 're right across the , uh , lake from , what , Plattsburgh ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] from Plattsburgh Air Force Base .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] But , um ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I had , I had a cousin that was stationed there , Plattsburgh for a while .
[B] He , he remembers lots of snow .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] Plattsburgh 's kind of a ,
[A] it 's , uh , it 's , uh , depressed economically .
[B] Oh , really , oh .
[A] When you go across the lake , um ,
[A] I do n't know why we have so much going for us ,
[A] I really do n't .
[A] I 'm , just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at Digital
[A] and they 've never had , well , they 've had layoffs recently ,
[A] but when we got hired here , no , no , never any layoffs , never , never ,
[A] and now we 're looking at serious ,
[A] I , I mean , I 'm a technician .
[B] Yeah .
[A] When they start getting rid of technicians ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] well , I 'm , I 'm working for T I , Texas Instruments , down here .
[A] Well , I interviewed with them .
[B] Oh , yeah ?
[A] But I did n't want to go to Texas .
[B] Oh , .
[A] Even though my , um , mother 's people are from Georgia .
[B] Oh ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] yeah .
[A] Well , I guess we have to get back to hobbies since ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] we 're getting to where ,
[A] Stick on the subject .
[B] we 're straying , I guess ,
[B] yeah .
[A] Well , interesting thing that I do is with , gardening , uh ,
[A] my sister grows flowers that you can dry ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and you can make fl- , uh , dried flower arrangements
[A] and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun .
[A] And we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with , uh , dried red flowers and dried white flowers and , uh , eucalyptus .
[B] Huh , yeah .
[A] Yo- , you know what eucalyptus is ?
[A] It 's ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] the , they s , uh , it 's sold in the hobby stores and nurseries .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it 's got a s- ,
[B] It 's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it
[B] but ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] at first I 'm like , oh , how , why do people like this ,
[A] but it , it is kind of a nice smell after a while .
[A] People put them in ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I did n't realize what it was for a while .
[B] I 'd walk into a room where some of that ,
[B] and I 'd wonder what is that ,
[B] you know ,
[B] and then one day I , I realized that it was eucalyptus .
[A] it 's , it 's , it 's , uh , like a fad thing .
[A] I , I do n't know .
[A] It 's , I 've never heard of it ,
[A] in the last five years I 've used so much of it that ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] I hate ,
[B] Is that the stuff that koala bears eat in Australia or something ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it is .
[B] Maybe that 's why they 're so slow .
[B] I guess they 're stoned on the stuff or something .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it , it looks really po , potent stuff .
[B] Yeah
[B] , yeah .
[A] But , uh , it 's , yeah , I think it 's the greatest stuff in the world , though .
[A] It 's , jeez ,
[A] they , I make all kinds of things with it .
[A] We make all kinds of things just with dried flowers .
[A] I , I almost want to start a business doing it ,
[A] but I do n't , I , I 'm so , uh , timid when it comes to starting a business .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's , that 's a big step ,
[B] yeah .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it is ,
[B] Yeah , uh ,
[A] especially with the , being in on the creative a- , aspect and the crafty end .
[A] You know , after a while you make some stuff ,
[A] then you start looking at it ,
[A] go , boy , this , this is kind of ugly .
[A] But I know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby .
[A] Um , he does it , believe it or not , I would n't imagine why , but to get out of the house , away from his wife ,
[A] because he 's a seasonal worker ,
[A] he works in the construction .
[A] And up here it 's almost a pattern ,
[A] and you see your fathers do it ,
[A] then their sons do it .
[A] What they do is they work construction ,
[A] then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter .
[A] And , uh , this guy was going nuts ,
[A] and his , uh , son built him a garage and got him some , uh , oh , I do n't know what the equipment 's called , but planers and things --
[B] Uh-huh ,
[A] -- and --
[B] shapers and planers and --
[A] -- s , set him up ,
[A] and h- , he makes ,
[B] -- routers .
[A] all kinds of furniture for , um , his kids ,
[A] and he makes , uh , uh , like little kids ' furniture .
[A] He gets right into it
[A] and , uh ,
[B] There was a program on T V down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little , little companies of one and two guys , you know , up there ,
[B] espec- , this particular one , I think , was in Maine and New Hampshire , where out in the , just kind of out in these little towns they 'd be in ,
[B] they may be the same kind of people you 're talking about .
[B] You know , they 've , they 've got twelve weeks to do something ,
[B] and they , they 're making furniture and just , you know , things like that during the winter
[B] and then they go off and do other things during the summer .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it 's a ,
[B] So , yeah ,
[A] it 's a really ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] good thing because it 's keeping him sane ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] and plus it 's keeping his marriage ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] so , and , and plus he 's getting on in his years now .
[A] He 's , he 's not that old ,
[A] but he 's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] to , to do something like that .
[A] And , uh , it 's really , it 's , it 's , uh , hard work .
[A] I could n't imagine taking lumber , raw lumber and trying to make something out of it .
[A] He d ,
[B] That would be really t , you know ,
[B] like say the ,
[A] He dowels everything .
[B] Oh , man ,
[B] yeah .
[A] And it 's all got to line up .
[A] It 's ,
[A] and , uh , I do n't think he goofs too much ,
[A] I do n't to , see too much scrap around .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] that 's , that 's something .
[B] Now our temperatures down here , we 're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties --
[A] God , I 'm envious .
[B] -- and , uh , so , and , uh , so as far as , you know , planting outdoor stuff , matter of fact , tonight I just got through , I was planting some , some trees out back tonight ,
[B] and , uh , this is , uh , it 's really nice ,
[A] Is it going to be ,
[B] out tonight .
[B] Almost hated to come , you know .
[A] Is it going to be really dry ?
[A] Uh , are you pl , are you ,
[A] now I always plant trees in the fall .
[A] I do n't know why
[A] so the , the cold weather can kill them --
[B] Yeah ,
[B] these were , uh ,
[A] -- but I guess ,
[B] trees that , that wintered .
[B] I do- , do n't know where they came from .
[B] They come out of nurseries mostly in Missouri and places like that .
[B] And they come down here
[B] and they 'll sit in the nurseries here
[B] and they 'll go ahead and , and , uh , leaf out .
[B] So what I 'm planting or actually transplanting is a tree that 's , or trees that are already leafed out .
[A] Oh , that 's good .
[A] I guess they , they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall , all .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Mostly , I think in a place where it 's really cold they do it in the fall ,
[B] let them winter --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- you know , through the fall ,
[B] but , uh , down here , well , it 's done both ways .
[B] It , it just kind of depends on what you 're , what you 're planting ,
[B] but , uh --
[A] Yeah ,
[A] and , uh ,
[B] -- all the shrubs and ,
[A] when you have time to do it .
[B] Yeah .
[A] My sister does , uh , flower gardens .
[A] She gets right into it .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] She spends lots of money on them .
[A] And I guess a lot of people do , do do that .
[A] They landscape their whole house with flower gardens .
[B] Yeah .
[A] She 's got like , just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and mulch ba- , tree bark all over her lawn .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Flowers , during the summer down here , the , the normal kind of flowers , there 's very few of them that will really do well .
[B] Everything does real well here in the spring until about , oh , first part of June
[B] and then the re- , the heat sets in .
[A] It gets , ya- ,
[B] And June , July , August are , you know ,
[B] most of the , those kind of plants just , are just barely staying alive , let alone make flowers .
[A] Do you have a lot of shade trees around your house
[A] or is it ,
[B] Uh , we 're in a relatively new area .
[B] We 're kind of out of , uh , the natural tree area .
[B] We 're kind of up on a , on a higher ,
[A] So you do n't have a lot of tree coverage ?
[B] on a slope .
[B] So we do n't have ,
[B] where we are right now there are very few trees .
[A] Because goi , going to make ,
[B] This was , this was , this was pasture land ,
[B] but down the , down the hill here a little ways there are parks that are , look like jungles , you know .
[B] They 're really ,
[A] Yeah .
[A] See , um , uh , where my , uh , well , my grandmother passed away , but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and they just shade everything .
[B] Now where is this ?
[A] Uh , it 's in Georgia .
[B] In Georgia ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] It 's , yeah , it 's right outside of Macon ,
[A] and , and it 's just a ,
[A] I like the way that , I like the way that idea of the south is ,
[A] but when I think of Texas , I think of nothing but , no trees and just grass .
[B] Well , I tell you what ,
[B] now , see , East Texas ,
[B] there 's two parts of Texas , East Texas and North Texas .
[B] Atlanta and Dallas are almost identical in every way , weather and everything .
[A] Yeah .
[B] The two cities are very , very identical ,
[B] so if you were familiar with Atlanta , uh ,
[A] So it 's that dry heat ?
[B] Uh , well , no ,
[B] it 's , it 's , uh , not dry at all .
[B] It , it 's humid .
[A] Well , where is it ,
[A] is it Hous- , was n't it Houston 's humid ?
[B] Hu- , Houston is awful .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Houston is really humid .
[B] No ,
[A] It 's humid .
