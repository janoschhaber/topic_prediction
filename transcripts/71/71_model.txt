[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] Okay
[B] movies .
[B] I have n't seen too many lately .
[B] I have kids
[B] and we went and saw THE RESCUERS DOWN UNDER , Under ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] over the , the break .
[B] Do , do you have kids you take to movies
[B] or ,
[A] No ,
[A] no kids .
[B] Yeah .
[B] It 's a Walt Disney movie
[B] and it did n't get as , you know , as good a reviews as like the LITTLE MERMAID , their last one , and got all kinds of Academy Awards and things last year .
[B] But this one was , I thought was excellent .
-----
[B] The MUMBLEx ,
[A] Was that the animated version ?
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it 's animated .
[B] And I ca n't believe how good they 're getting with their animation now .
-----
[B] It 's just , just the special effects , you know .
[B] And in this movie , this , there 's this boy
[B] and he rescues this , uh , bald eagle
[B] and , uh , and it 's a huge eagle , you know , wing span of twenty feet or something like that .
[B] And the boy actually rides on his back
[B] and he rides through the clouds , you know ,
[B] and you see him coming out of the clouds , his head coming out and then the bird coming out ,
[B] and it , you know , they 're flying all over with it .
[B] And I mean , I know they , there must have used , been computers or something for animation this day ,
[B] but it was just so real , realistic and lifelike and good animation .
[B] It was a good show .
[A] Even better than ROGER RABBIT insofar as animation ?
-----
[B] Well , ROGER was a composite one .
[A] Yeah .
[B] There 's one , there 's a movie I 've seen , ROGER RABBIT .
[B] That 's not a recent movie ,
[B] but , uh , I enjoyed that show .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that was made in a few , I do n't know , several years back , I guess .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] Latest , latest one I 've saw which was a mistake to go see was LIONHEART ,
[A] had Claude Van Damme .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] He was , he 's of course , uh , I guess he 's trained in this , uh , martial arts of some sort ,
[A] but the plot was bland ,
-----
[A] the acting was bland .
[A] It was just mostly centered upon his abilities to --
[B] Chop them up , huh ?
-----
[A] -- yeah ,
[A] chop them up ,
[A] exactly .
[A] And ,
[B] This is supposed to be the , the guy that 's , uh , replaces Bruce Lee or whatever or ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] or the next Chuck Norris type of guy .
[A] Or he 's singular I guess , you know .
[A] You know how they can make any of , any single one of them in a movie to be a --
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- super --
[B] Superstar .
[A] -- superstar of any sort , you know ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] but Chuck Norris , of course , could be just about equal ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] if not more
[A] or , and all of them , I guess , could be in that fashion ,
[B] Hum .
[A] or category .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] uh-huh .
[A] It was about , uh , a ,
[B] MUMBLEx .
[A] French Foreign Legion fellow who deserts to go help his brother 's wife who got , who became a widow because he was selling drugs ,
[A] and he got killed .
[B] Really uplifting , huh ?
-----
[A] So he deserts and goes to New York
[A] and he starts out by fighting to make money ,
[A] and then he moves on to L A to where that , where she is to just help him out .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] It was really , I mean the Hollywood really must think there 's some real dummies out there or something .
[A] I do n't know .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I have n't heard , I had n't heard much about that movie .
[B] I ,
[B] other than it was a chop them up movie .
-----
[B] But , uh , well , I guess that 's one I wo n't go see .
[A] Well , it was worth the buck I guess .
[B] Oh , you went to the dollar movie ?
-----
[B] Yeah .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] they show up at the dollar movie right after they get , come out .
[B] You know they 're usually not , not that great or did n't do that great anyway .
[A] A lot of ,
-----
[B] Let me see .
[B] Let me see
[B] another movie I watched .
[B] Uh , I want to see , uh , that new one , uh , that won all those Academy Awards this year , DANCES WITH WOLVES .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I have n't seen that .
[B] Have you seen that one yet ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] What , what , what ,
[A] I , I absorbed all of that movie in one sitting .
[A] Uh , I guess what made it so good was the cinema- , cinematography ,
-----
[B] The , the wide open , the spaces ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] and the music
[A] and , uh , well , it had an excellent story line .
-----
[A] Everything about it was good .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Um , I thought an excellent one , too , was MISERY with Kathy Bates and James Caan .
[A] I 'm not a James Caan fan ,
[A] but that was a well directed and acted movie .
[B] Is that right ?
[A] I 'd recommend it .
[A] It 's a little on the violent side --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- but then what movie is n't anymore .
[B] Right ,
[B] right .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] our movies today , it used to be X
-----
[B] and , you know , and P G -s used to be R -s
[B] and , seems like the rating system , you know , is kind of switching that way a little bit .
[A] Well , I have no objections to it .
[A] It 's just , uh ,
[A] and it 's a matter of your taste , uh ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[B] Oh , yeah .
-----
[B] It 's just that ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] it 's just that the rating system seems , you know , instead of having X now , they have what , N C seventeen ?
[A] Yeah .
[B] They just changed it because X had a connotation with it , you know ,
[B] so ,
[A] And even on those type they do n't show what you expect .
-----
[B] Right .
[B] A lot of those are really violent type movies .
[A] Right .
[B] Really gory .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that seems to be the norm of most movies ,
-----
[A] but --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- what the hey .
[A] This is America .
[B] Let me see .
-----
[B] One movie I saw , I guess it was a while back , RED OCTOBER .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Have you seen that one ?
[A] Yes ,
[A] I have .
-----
[A] That was pretty good .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I read the book before
[B] so I knew the story line going in ,
-----
[B] but they changed some things in the movie .
[B] It was n't the same .
[B] I thought the book was better than the movie ,
[B] but I thought the movie was really good as well .
[A] I always wait for the movie .
-----
[A] I do n't have time to read the book .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I do n't ,
[B] I read about one or two thick novels like that a year .
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] You know ,
[B] that 's about all the time I can , I can spare .
[B] But that was a good show I thought , you know .
[B] I read about how they did , uh , an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine .
[B] You know , that was n't a real submarine you saw in the water .
[B] It was , it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic .
[A] Yeah .
[B] All those underwater scenes .
[B] I thought , you know ,
[B] it looked to me like it was a real submarine ,
[A] They MUMBLEx ,
[B] that was in the water , you know .
[A] That 's the magic of Hollywood , special effects .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I hear this movie F X part two coming out is , uh , pretty good .
[B] Is that right ?
-----
[A] Did you ever see the original one ?
[B] I did n't .
[A] It was , uh ,
-----
[A] you ought to rent the , uh , F X part one .
[A] It does n't say part one ,
[A] but it , it 's F slash X .
[B] Huh . What 's that about ?
-----
[A] A , uh , special effects man who somehow gets involved in this , um ,
[A] oh , I 'm not sure .
[A] I ca n't remember .
[A] It 's been a while since I 've seen it .
[A] But he , he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody
[A] and he has to go underground ,
[A] and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done .
[B] Hm .
[A] And , uh ,
[B] To , to fool people
[B] and MUMBLEx ,
[A] Right ,
[A] and using makeup and using the --
-----
[B] All the tricks .
[A] -- all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] That sounds like an interesting concept .
[A] But you need to rent the first one first .
-----
[B] To understand what 's going on in the second ?
[A] Uh , if , if that is that the second one follows the first .
[A] I do n't know if they have the , uh , original actors on that first one to that one .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] They 're supposed to be coming out with all these Desert Storm movies ,
[A] Oh .
[B] this summer , too .
[A] I expected those .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I mean , Hollywood , I mean they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there , I think .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Well , they had some ,
[B] in some of those , you know , they , I guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about Lebanese and , and , you know , and ,
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and Americans
[B] and they decide , oh , make it Iraqis and Americans , you know ,
[B] and they just change the title and , uh , and reshot a few parts , you know , where they , yeah , you know , where they could .
[B] I guess they figured we would n't , ca n't tell the difference between an ,
[A] Actual names ,
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] will not be used .
[B] Right .
[A] Eventually I 'm sure they will come out with the ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] the , the proper names .
[B] Right .
[B] It was such a ,
[B] it ,
[B] I guess they , they 'll probably come out with a lot of movies , you know .
-----
[B] It was , it was such a rout though , you know .
[B] I do n't know , you know ,
[B] they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or ,
[A] Latest story ,
[B] or about , or about those two newsmen or whatever that got captured .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Kevin Costner I understand is supposed to be play Schwartzkopf , supposedly .
-----
[B] Is that right ?
[A] I do n't know .
[A] That 's just one of the many rumors that floats around .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Or what you read .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Well , I think we 've probably ,
-----
[A] Pretty much used up the tape , I guess .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] it 's been about five minutes .
[B] It 's been nice talking with you .
[A] Same .
[A] And , uh , we 'll --
[B] Keep on watching those movies , huh ?
-----
[A] -- Talk to you on the next go around .
[B] Okay .
[B] Bye-bye .
[A] Adios .
