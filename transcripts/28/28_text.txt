[A] Okay .
[B] Okay .
[A] I was trying to get my children quiet for a minute .
[B] Okay .
[A] Well , credit cards , boy , that 's an easy topic ,
[B] Ye- ,
[A] is n't it .
[B] Yes ,
[B] it is .
[B] It 's one we all hold dear and near , I 'm sure .
[A] Oh , yes ,
[A] yes .
[A] I guess I 've had some good experience and some bad experience with them .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] most of mine 's been pretty good , although I 'm , I guess I 'm like a lot of other people , now ,
[B] I 'm trying to , to pay off my credit cards
[B] and , and , uh , I 've done pretty good at it .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Well , I do fairly good until I go in the store and I see something I want .
[A] You know --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- not need , want .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] there is a big difference .
[A] There 's a big difference there .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] But most of mine that I use is strictly gasoline .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] oh yeah ,
[B] I , I do that ,
[B] I do that ,
[B] but the rest , like I said , the rest of them I 've been trying to , to pay off --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and , uh , get back on a cash basis , except for gas .
[B] It 's too easy to , to run into the gas station .
[A] Oh , it sure is --
[B] And , MUMBLEx .
[A] -- especially when you work out of town and everything , that way .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] At least that 's for me .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[B] So .
[A] But yeah ,
[A] I 've , I 've talked to some who 's really had some bad experience
[A] and kind of knock on wood I have n't yet , not bad .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] well that 's ,
[A] You know , I just , I 'm just shocked at the end of the month ,
[A] to see what damage I have did ,
[A] but ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] I try to keep it pretty reasonable .
[B] Well , I 've been pretty lucky in that respect .
[B] I do n't charge , like I say , I 've , I been trying to , to not charge except for emergencies .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , uh , so , but I have n't really had any bad problems with credit cards .
[B] There 's , you know ,
[B] they have , uh , wonderful features ,
[B] they 're there when you need them .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[B] You know , like in emergencies , or whatever .
[A] And then they have bad drawbacks , too .
[B] Yeah .
[B] It 's , it 's awfully easy .
[A] I mean high interest ,
[A] it 's like paying twice .
[B] That 's true ,
[B] that 's true ,
[A] Yes ,
[A] so , MUMBLEx .
[B] I try to ,
[B] I did switch to one , uh , sponsored by the credit union , though . That seems to be a pretty low interest .
[A] Oh , uh-huh .
[B] Yeah , compared to some of the other ones .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[B] And you do n't have an annual fee there ,
[B] and that helps .
[A] Oh , yes .
[A] Uh , we used to have , you know , like several ,
[A] but right now , we 're just more or less at American Express ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] you know ,
[A] and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's one way to do it , because that , that forces you to pay for it --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- instead of saying , well , I 'll just --
[A] Pay fifteen ,
[A] yeah .
[B] -- pay on it this month
[B] and ,
[A] Yes ,
[A] I know ,
[A] yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time .
[B] Takes a long time ,
[B] that 's right .
[A] It sure does .
[B] And now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off , off your income tax --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- that 's , you know .
[B] Of course it 's been going down for a number of years ,
[B] but this is the last year you can take anything .
[B] So .
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] yeah .
[B] So .
[A] Well , I 've enjoyed talking to you .
[B] Well , I 've enjoyed talking to you .
[A] And maybe we 'll get to talk again .
[B] Okay .
[A] Okay ,
[A] bye-bye .
[B] Bye-bye .
