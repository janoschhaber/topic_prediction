[A] Okay , uh ,
[A] why do you think it , uh , sounds ,
[A] do you think we should adopt it ?
[B] No ,
[B] I do n't like metric system .
[A] You do n't ?
[B] I , I , I think the country is , is , uh , too ingrained in the inches and , and just the general , uh , background ,
[B] the history of our country has been inches
[B] and I do n't think there 's a big advantage in going to the metric system .
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] It , it 's going to disorient and confuse a lot of people for years and years
[B] and there are going to be people who die because of it because they do n't understand , uh , you know , simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and you know how far away something is
[B] and it 's , it 's not in our national consciousness to do it .
[B] We 've always measured things in the English system --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- and , you know , everything , you know ,
[B] our land is in acres ,
[B] our people are n't going to understand what --
[A] Right .
-----
[B] -- an amount of something is .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I , I agree with you .
[A] I do n't think we should either even though I know there are benefits to the metric system ,
[A] I do n't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the , the disadvantages that would happen to the people in America --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- and also the , uh ,
[A] I do n't know
[A] it seems almost like there 's this , it 's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we 'll look good to the other nations
[A] because I think they , that 's an area that the other nations , especially Europe , look down on us like oh , we 're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system , who have n't really attained it yet .
[A] And I feel it 's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us .
[A] And it 's like , hey , we 're content with this .
[A] No ,
[A] it 's probably not as accurate ,
[A] probably , you know , intellectually does n't ,
[A] it 's not as sound intellectually , but , like you said I mean , come on .
[A] I had six years of college
[A] and I do n't know the metric system and I do n't care to learn it --
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] -- and I 'm not some kind of an idiot ,
[A] I just ,
[B] And it 's easy to trans- ,
[B] we have a computer for just about everything now
[B] and if it 's necessary to translate back and forth between them , it can be done --
[A] Yeah .
-----
[B] -- because I 'm a mechanical engineer
[B] and I 've had to work when I was designing packages for people ,
[B] I mean I had to , to work both systems --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- back and forth
[B] and it was not hard
[B] and you get , you can get a CAT CAM system that can take any design you want
[B] and you can push a button
[B] and it 'll convert every measurement on there --
[A] Right .
-----
[B] -- you know , from one system to the other --
[A] There 's a lot of --
[B] -- in seconds .
[A] -- people ,
[A] like you 're educated ,
[A] I 'm educated ,
[A] my husband is ,
[A] but , I mean , a lot of people are flat not educated
[A] and if I have a hard time , you know --
[B] Really .
-----
[A] -- putting that into my life , can we put that off on the other eighty percent of the population that does n't have any college
[A] or I do n't know how much of the --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- you know ,
[A] but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population --
[B] Absolutely .
[A] -- they do n't have any college probably much at all
[A] and if we ca n't take it and use it easily , well , how can you put that on , like , elderly people and --
[B] Oh , yeah ,
[B] it 's just ,
[A] -- you know , just people that maybe just are n't blessed with as , as much sharpness and ment , mental acuity ,
[B] Or , or even have had the ability , you know , the chance to , to go to college or to , to --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- to learn about ,
-----
[B] I think it 's still good they do cover the system .
[B] I think it should still be taught in schools .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And they do ,
[B] I know now because I ,
[B] even when I was in elementary school years ago --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- they were , you know , we learned what a centimeter was and a decimeter and the various , you know --
[A] Right .
[B] -- basically the other alternate forms of measurements , things like that .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And , and that 's acceptable .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I think it failed , too ,
[A] because like what you said of just , you know , hey this is ridiculous .
[A] The thing Americans have so much stress on them right now .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I mean if you look at the average family it 's , like , man , they barely have time to stop and get gas , much less to try and figure out how much gas they 're really getting and --
[B] Really .
-----
[A] -- do all this .
[A] It 's like , I mean come on let 's take the pressure ,
[B] You know you need twenty gallons , but do you need how many liters .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] and it 's just like another thing --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- the American family does n't need any more pressure .
[A] Just leave them alone ,
[A] let them measure their drinking water in cups
[A] and --
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] -- leave them alone .
[B] And it , it just does n't , MUMBLEx it just does n't make that much difference in the average life
[B] and the scientific community and places where it 's needed --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- you know , that 's fine
[B] and the rest of the world , I mean , we are ,
[B] it 's not ,
[B] we may not be the top ,
[B] I do n't know if we 're the top ,
[B] we 're one of the top superpowers of the world .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] That 's ,
[B] It may be arrogant ,
[B] but I mean , let them come to us .
[B] That 's kind of the way I feel about it .
[B] We can convert ,
[A] And , and if they do n't like the way we do it just get off our , do n't worry about it . And I think ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it , it 's kind of like expecting everyone to suddenly speak German .
[A] Right ,
[A] it is --
[B] You know .
[A] -- because it is another language ,
[A] yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[B] And , and , instead of saying the world speak German we found out that we can translate .
[B] And that 's what I think we ought to do with the metric system .
[A] That 's funny .
[A] Well , that 's good .
[A] I think we kept it at real good .
[B] Okay .
[A] Is that all we need to say ?
[B] Yeah .
[B] It 's been nice talking to you .
[A] You , too .
[A] I think that was good .
[B] Okay .
[A] That was the best one .
[A] Usually I get distracted off the topic .
[A] You know what I mean .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And we 'll end up , one man was telling me about his grandfather in Lithuania ,
[A] and we were talking about something tot- , income tax or something .
[B] . All right .
[A] And I just ,
[B] Well , good talking to you .
[A] Anyway , I appreciate it .
[A] Have a good day .
[B] Bye-bye .
