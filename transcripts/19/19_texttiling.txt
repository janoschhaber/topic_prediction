[A] All right , uh ,
[A] I , I would like to talk about , just briefly What happened over there in Saudi Arabia in the political context .
[A] I think it 's , uh , refreshing to see the , uh , the support that the President got from the American people .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it , we , I , I read an interesting article in the paper that discussed , uh , that , uh ,
[B] seemed that every other time a President tried to get support for an action like , uh , uh , President Carter and his thing with the , the hostage crisis ,
[A] Right .
[B] and he always did it through rhetoric .
[A] Right .
[B] And this time President Bush did it through action
[B] and he ,
[A] Um .
-----
[B] he drove policy by the course he took and almost forced public support ,
[A] Yes .
[B] or , uh , I mean , he left almost no alternative .
[A] That 's right .
[B] And , and it was very interesting how he did it
[B] and , uh , I mean , I 'm , I 'm an Air Force Officer ,
[B] so it , uh ,
[A] Really .
[B] it was interesting for me , uh , you know ,
[B] I 'd certainly , uh ,
[B] I , I mean I think it 's great that all the support .
[B] I have , uh , friends of mine from the Air ,
[B] I 'm , I 'm an engineer and work in the Rolm Laboratory ,
[A] Right .
-----
[B] but other engi- , guys here on base ,
[B] this is a B fifty-two base where I work ,
[B] so ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] we had about a thousand people gone from the base that went over there
[B] and they 're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it .
[A] That 's great , um ,
[A] if , if you remember , the vote in the Congress to authorize war , if necessary , was actually pretty close .
[B] Yes
[B] it was .
[A] And if , if my memory serves me right , I believe a majority of Democrats may even have opposed it ,
[A] it , it was ,
[B] Yeah ,
-----
[B] I 'm , I do n't know the exact figure
[B] but I , I would imagine that because of the , how close the , the vote was I 'm , uh , I mean almost certainly would have to be .
[B] Just based on the sheer numbers of , uh , the disparity of , excuse me , Democrats and Republicans in Congress he 'd think that it would have to have been , um .
[A] That 's right .
-----
[B] And , uh , I , I
[B] gosh this , uh , this whole thing now with all the , uh , all the political cartoons on the Democrats and how they 're , uh , uh ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] they 're in , in a sad way for ninety-two now in terms of the presidential election , anyway .
[A] Especially the ones that came out and said , oh come on guys , let 's talk about this little while longer .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] I mean how many years are we going to wait
[A] and , and what , what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time .
[B] Right ,
[B] right ,
[B] I think that was ,
[B] all those factors played a part in , you know , uh , the ,
[A] No doubt .
[B] everyone was discussing whether we should , uh , wait longer ,
-----
[B] but , I , I , I know that there 's a lot of reasons to wait longer
[B] but I think we were genuinely concerned about how , their military capability
[B] and we , uh , I think we over estimated it ,
[B] but still ,
[A] I think so too .
[B] we were really , highly concerned about it
[B] and , that we were worried that they were getting dug in
[B] and , uh .
[A] Well they were ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] and in fact they were so well dug in that , uh , when we sent our tanks around behind them they could n't get turned around in time .
[B] Right ,
[B] they could n't , yeah they could n't ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] it 's true
[B] they ,
[B] Saddam thought he had the whole thing , uh , figured out to , to which way we were coming and which , what , what our doctrine was that , uh ,
[A] Well , had , had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor .
-----
[B] That 's right ,
[B] that 's true .
[B] That 's interesting ,
[B] I think , uh , this political situation over there now is , uh , uh ,
[B] it 'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether the , this opposition will , uh , uh ,
[B] today the Turks , uh , agreed to support the Kurds , which is something they 've never done before
[A] Um , interesting .
[B] And , uh , this ,
[B] and the Israelis , uh , and not the Israelis but the Arabs all of a sudden are , uh , are cheering for Baker on his drive for , to reconcile relations with the Israelis ,
[B] so it 's like ,
[A] Well , Baker is really not very much pro Israel .
-----
[B] Yeah
[B] I ,
[A] And did you know John Sununu is , uh , half Arab ?
[B] No , uh ,
[B] I , I think I did hear that at one time a long time ago ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] because I used to live in , uh , Massachusetts ,
[B] but , uh ,
[A] Right ,
[A] in , in fact , when he was Governor of New Hampshire , I believe .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] New Hampshire .
[A] Okay .
-----
[A] I believe he was the only one of fifty governors that voted against some kind of resolution of support for Israel a few years back .
[B] Oh my gosh .
[A] And , uh , now he is a conservative ,
[A] but he is not a conservative that favors Israel ,
[B] Uh .
-----
[A] and that , that concerns me greatly .
[B] Well , I do n't ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] I 'd certainly , uh , support Israel in , in their , their policy that in defending themselves and in , uh , in their handling of their foreign policy ,
[B] I think , I think the stand they have , or , or the way the command respect , I , I support that .
[B] I think that is a , a positive thing for them after , um , uh , thousands of years ,
[B] they have to , uh , they ha ,
[B] I think they in ,
[B] when they be , became a country they more than , or , more or less decided they were n't going to take it anymore ,
[B] and , uh .
[A] Well , they did n't have much choice ,
-----
[A] they could either fight or die .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] exactly , exactly
[B] and , uh , um , so , gee ,
[B] I lost my train of thought here .
[B] But , uh , um , so , okay
[B] so I ca n't say whether that , that I 'm pro Israel or anti Israel .
[B] I mean , I 'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region
[B] and looks uh , that the joining of forces for this , uh , uh , Desert Shield and Desert Storm thing ended up being a positive thing .
[A] It is a positive thing , um ,
[A] however , uh , every time an organization such as the P L O says well we 'll see if we can work with Israel , then , uh , they get embarrassed some , every few months by documents that reveal that their ultimate purpose is to totally eliminate them .
[B] Right .
[A] And so you , you basically have , uh , mutually exclusive interests ,
[A] either Israel is going to occupy the area ,
[A] or the Arabs are going to occupy the area
[A] and I 'm just not sure that , that there 's going to be any easy permanent solution .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] somebody 's going to ,
[B] and I think that 's the problem the P L O has is that when they , whenever one group of them decides that they 're going to negotiate , or they 're going to do something , they 're going to try to make some peace , but , uh , the end result is that they , there so many factions of them and , uh , some more violent than others , some with a certain agenda different than the others , or they split ,
[B] they end up being , becoming divisive themselves .
[A] Exactly .
[B] Uh , I ,
[B] it 's interesting ,
[A] It is .
[B] I , I 'm , I 'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months ,
[B] but , uh , that 's ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I , I commend Israel for their restraint in not responding to the Scud attacks .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I know ,
[B] that , that is almost , I mean that 's absolutely unprecedented
[B] that was ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] an , an incredible foreign policy coup on the part of the President and the State Department .
[A] Exactly ,
[A] exactly .
[B] And that , I mean that 's never happened before ,
[A] No .
[B] and I do n't know if it will ever happen again
[B] but ,
[A] May not .
[A] Well it 's been fun , I enjo , enjoyed talking with you .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] okay , uh ,
[B] I guess , uh , well maybe the computer will pair us up together another time .
[A] You never know .
[B] All right .
[A] Bye , bye .
[B] Bye , bye .
