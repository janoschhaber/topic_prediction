[A] Ok- , okay .
[B] What , what is ,
[B] do you have a favorite recipe ?
[A] Um , yeah ,
[A] that 's what it said to discuss some maybe a recipe ,
[A] well , it says , why would you , what you would have for a dinner party .
[A] Um , this is strange because I pressed one and I thought it said begin .
[B] Oh .
[A] Okay ,
[A] maybe , maybe we 're all set .
[A] Okay ,
[A] we 'll talk for five minutes ,
[A] they interrupt at the end .
[A] Um , yeah ,
[A] it says what you would have for a dinner party ,
[A] I just happen to plan one out for Saturday
[A] I 'll tell you ,
[B] Oh , that 's wonderful .
-----
[A] what I 'm going to have .
[B] Okay .
[A] Um , if I can find it .
[A] Well , I have this new fondue pot
[A] and I was going to do basic cheese fondue ,
[A] and I have two different kinds of breads and some ham
[A] and I was going to try something weird which , you know ,
[A] when you have fish au gratin ,
[A] I was going to make some , uh , like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue .
[A] I do n't know if it will come out .
[B] That 's ,
[B] what kind of fondue , the cheese dip or ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] the cheese fondue I make ,
[A] some people like swiss , um ,
[A] I prefer cheddar .
[A] And I 'll mix ,
[A] I wo n't make , I wo n't have a sharp cheddar because it , for fondue I think it should be a little calmer than real sharp ,
[B] Right .
-----
[A] cheddar .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And then I was going to make other things like potato skins .
[B] Oh , that sounds good .
[A] It- , see you do n't necessarily have to dip this stuff .
[A] And , um , I was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a , a vegetable .
[B] That 's always a good thing .
-----
[B] Vegetable trays always go over so well , because I think people get tired of eating junk .
[B] I mean , I think they like to have healthy stuff too ,
[B] you know it 's ,
[A] Oh , yeah ,
[A] it 's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party .
[B] Oh , definitely .
[B] I think better even than , than other kinds of food .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] instead of something greasy or ,
[B] Right ,
[B] exactly .
[B] Yeah .
[A] MUMBLEx my , uh , girlfriends do catering
[A] and they always , about every party they do is they have a vegetable tray .
[A] I think they try and suggest it .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] What I 've been doing when I get invited someplace and bring something , I make , uh , food kabobs .
[A] You take little toothpicks and cut up ,
[B] Oh .
[A] uh , pineapple and strawberry ,
[B] Yes .
[A] and even banana if you can do it just before you leave .
[B] Right .
-----
[A] It stays nice and fresh .
[B] Right ,
[B] that 's true .
[B] Or even have you ever seen where they , they 'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and then put the fruit in the watermelon that is really neat MUMBLEx .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I like those .
[B] Yep .
-----
[A] Um , they , they made a couple of those , uh ,
[A] they made one for my , uh , bridal shower
[A] and I was pretty pleased .
[A] I never made one for myself though .
[A] But they look easy enough to make
[A] it 's not ,
[B] Oh , I think it would , it would be a lot of work
[B] but , um ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] you know , because it 's , you know ,
[B] you have to cut each thing or , you know , use the melon baller and stuff
[B] but , but I think they 're really neat
[B] and , you know , I think they 're worth the time , you know , because they ,
[A] Yeah ,
-----
[A] you probably get this , probably pretty sticky after you get done .
[B] Oh , yeah
[A] Then you 've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because , you know , when you scrape it , it makes the water .
[B] Right .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] um , something I do is a fruit ,
[A] is , I 'll get , um , make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I have two nieces
[A] and they , they MUMBLEx they go melt some chocolate chips , .
[A] Go buy me some strawberries .
[B] Is that , is that good ?
[B] You know , I 've seen that so many times , strawberries dipped in chocolate
[B] but I 've never tried it ,
[B] are they really good ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] ther- , you know , if you get a sweet strawberry they 're much better ,
[A] but if you get a sour strawberry ,
[B] Oh , I bet it does n't mix well , does it ?
[A] Huh . Yeah ,
[A] no ,
[A] they , um , the strawberries are coming in season now from ,
[A] they 're , they 're coming up from Florida , of course .
[A] I live in Vermont ,
[A] so . But they 're really reasonably priced ,
[A] they 're coming up from Florida ,
[A] so .
[B] Oh , well , that 's good
[B] because I know they 've been really expensive lately .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Because they were n't in season ,
[B] of course , they had to be , be , uh , grown in greenhouses and stuff and in ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I think the , uh , actually I think they get , um , some of them from South America .
[B] Oh , is that right ?
[A] Yep ,
[A] they ,
[A] a lot of , um , of a , um , winter produce comes from South America .
[B] Oh , I MUMBLEx .
[A] Of course , their seasons are switched .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Right .
[A] So , um , do you want to discuss the recipe ?
[B] Well ,
[A] I have a recipe if you want .
[B] Okay ,
[B] sure , su- ,
[A] Um , it filled ,
[A] a lot of people try to stay away from this
[A] but I make my own homemade pudding just because I do n't like box pudding .
[B] Is that right ?
[B] I 've never heard of that .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it , and it MUMBLEx if you , um , well ,
[A] first of all I MUMBLEx take about a quarter and a half of milk
[A] and I put it in a two quart saucepan
[A] and you put it on a really low heat .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it , it ends up burning ,
[A] I mean , no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I do n't let that worry me .
[A] And I get the milk lukewarm
[A] and then I pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it
[A] and I have this thing
[A] it 's called the slender blender ,
[A] it , it makes the , uh , it makes , uh , a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough .
[A] It 's , uh , I do n't know ,
[A] they 're called moo goo leaves or something
[A] they 're sl- ,
[B] I think I know what you 're talk ,
[B] is it like a hand held ?
[A] Yeah .
[A] They 're real neat .
[B] The ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] okay .
[A] I think they 're real reasonably priced ,
[A] some of them , they used to be a hundred dollars ,
[A] and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert
[A] but I did n't get that one ,
[A] I got the Black and Decker kind .
[A] But , uh , it 's real handy because it does n't have a cord
[A] and you beat this cornstarch right into the mil- , the milk , you know ,
[A] and it does an excellent job ,
[A] or just hand beat it .
[A] I guess you could use a hand mixer
[A] but I do n't think it pur- , I do n't think it gets it good enough .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And then before the milk gets too hot , um , I add two beaten eggs and I really mix them in good . And then about a half a cup of sugar
[A] and I let it pretty much ,
[A] I beat it like every minute for about ten seconds
[A] and it 's , it starts thickening ,
[A] when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little , I do n't know ,
[A] it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch ,
[A] and you just keep beating it in .
[A] And it 's the ,
[A] the trick is , is to have this blender ,
[A] so , if you were ,
[A] you 'd have to probably almost go out
[A] and MUMBLEx someone who 's just going to make it first time , it 's ,
[A] you 'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders .
[B] Huh .
[A] And then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate
[A] or after it 's thickened I cook it for a good ,
[A] once it starts boiling , I just , I cook it for a good seven minutes ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] seven to ten minutes
[A] and then you can make chocolate
[A] or you can take it off and let it cool MUMBLEx
[A] you put , um , really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter
[A] and that makes french vanilla , um , custard .
[A] Yeah ,
[B] Oh , wow .
[B] That is really interesting .
[B] Are you saying to use like , um , for chocolate like , unsweetened ,
[A] A chocolate powder .
[B] unsweetened ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that cocoa , yeah , the unsweetened .
[A] It comes in like a real dark can ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] our mothers used to use it .
[A] And then ,
[B] Ri- , I have some .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] we all used to ,
[B] I just want to ,
[A] yeah
[A] it 's the unsweetened kind
[A] it 's not like Nestles Quik .
[B] Right .
[B] Okay .
[A] I suppose you could use that .
[A] I- ,
[B] Cooking chocolate .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] but , um ,
[B] That 's really interesting ,
[B] I 've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before that 's really neat .
[A] Well , I used to make the regular pudding , the chocolate and put it in the pie shell
[A] and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day , where you cut the pie , it would soak into the pie shell
[A] and it was like red ,
[A] and I 'm like , oh ,
[A] this is kind of groedy .
[B] Well , how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own ?
[A] Um , actually I found it in one of my mother 's , um , homemade cookbooks ,
[A] I mean ,
[B] Is that right ?
[A] something she had collected out of WOMAN 'S DAY or something .
[B] Oh , neat ,
[A] So ,
[B] that is just really neat .
[B] Because I ,
[A] I think you could n't make it with a hand whisk or , or a regular beater
[A] but , um ,
[B] It would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] but I still think a beater would do it good enough , um ,
[A] the trick is to get the cornstarch ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] um , yeah
[A] right in the , in the lukewarm milk .
[A] Sometimes I put the cornstarch in a separate bowl
[A] and I would put it in the sink
[A] and I 'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good .
[A] It seems to be better than putting the , the cornstarch into the liquid
[A] it , once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top .
[B] So you put the milk in the cornstarch ?
[A] Yeah .
[A] And I 'll do this , uh ,
[A] sometimes MUMBLEx I 'll put my after I pour that into my , back into my saucepan .
[A] I 'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg .
[A] So ,
[B] And then put that back in the saucepan ?
[A] Yep .
[A] And then , you know , if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to . The cocoa even seems to thicken it even more .
[B] Huh that 's ,
[A] Because by the vanilla does n't seem to thicken as well as the ,
[A] sometimes the cocoa is
[A] like , my husband really likes it thick
[A] he says , I can stick the spoon right in this .
[B] Oh .
[A] Because I 'm always worrying it wo n't firm up because it , when you take it out of the saucepan it 's like , boy , I hope this thickens a little more because it 's not like real package thick , you know ,
[A] when you cook a package ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] it 's , it 's a little less ,
[A] but I put it in a nice glass bowl
[A] and , um , some people do n't like that , that , film on the pudding
[A] so you can put , uh , Saran Wrap over the top .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the Saran Wrap ,
[A] so , when you pull the Saran Wrap back , you sort of should be a little careful , pull it back and shake the water off the Saran Wrap
[A] and I might put it back on .
[A] But , um ,
[B] Do yo- , do you put it in the refrigerator then
[B] or y- ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] after , well when it starts steaming a lot , uh , I definitely , yeah , put it in the refrigerator ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] but , um , I ,
[A] my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you 're going to make it work too hard .
[B] Right ,
[B] that 's true .
[B] I knew that .
[A] That 's ,
[A] yeah ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] so , , that 's why I do that .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So , well , I do n't know
[A] that 's my , my great hard recipe .
