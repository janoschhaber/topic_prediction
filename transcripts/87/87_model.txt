[A] Okay ,
-----
[A] we 're going to talk about the public school system ,
[B] Okay .
[A] What 's wrong with it , an , or if anything is wrong with it and what we can do about it , what should be done about it .
[B] Fantastic .
[B] Well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is , uh , about the , uh , funding of , the , the school system right now .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] Evidently , uh , that 's , that 's a big problem .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it 's amazing , uh ,
[A] I always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough , I mean ,
[B] Right .
[A] to be doing what they 're doing , uh .
[A] When I was in college I , I enjoyed teaching ,
[A] 'cause I did some teaching part-time
[A] and I really enjoyed that
[A] but I would n't want to go teach high school or junior high ,
[A] it just , you know , all the problems .
-----
[B] Oh , Lord , I mean , yeah ,
[B] an , you talk about stress and pressure ,
[B] I tell you what ,
[B] it 's , uh ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] they 're putting in fifty , sixty hours a week ,
[A] I 'm sure , because they 've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready .
[B] Do ,
[B] right .
[A] And , you know , and they 're being paid , probably half what most people being paid .
[B] Exactly ,
[B] and ,
[A] And we 're paying basketball people , you know , millions of dollars a year for , for what , you know .
[B] That 's right ,
[B] and then they , uh , poof it off , you know , do like Tarpley .
[A] Yeah .
[B] But , uh , I MUMBLEx
[B] what gets me is I ca n't believe that Congress , uh , or , our state legislature ca n't come up with , uh , some kind of workable means to have funds for the school .
-----
[B] You know , it 's , uh ,
[B] I just do n't understand that .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it 's , uh .
-----
[A] Now do you have little kids , or what ?
[B] No , uh ,
[B] sure do n't ,
[B] my wife and I 've just been married about two years
[B] but I have a sister that 's a , uh , school teacher ,
[B] and , uh .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] my wife and I have a , a three year old , almost four and a , a two year old .
[B] Okay .
[A] So we 're looking at the , the older one going to school next year . Not , not , well not this coming fall but the year after that .
-----
[B] Okay ,
[B] so it 's getting close .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] he 's going to be going to kindergarten ,
[A] so .
[B] Right .
[A] So , you know , we 're , we 're thinking about that .
[A] What 's that going to be like .
[A] Are they going to be taught nothing ,
[A] or they going be taught something ,
[A] we 're going to , we 're going to be involved in our child 's education .
[A] We 're going to be teaching him what we can at home , of course ,
[B] Right .
[A] because , uh , I guess we do n't trust the school system , which is very sad , uh ,
[A] but .
[B] Exactly .
[A] But if it does n't start at home , it 's not going to go anywhere .
[B] Right ,
[B] that 's true .
[A] You know ,
[A] and we 're going to try to teach him good values , because , you know , we , when , when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them , well hey , if you can play football or basketball that 's what 's important . Not if you can read or write , or do , or un , understand some science .
[B] Exactly .
[A] You know ,
[A] I mean give me a break ,
-----
[A] that 's , that 's , that 's bogus .
[B] Right ,
[B] right .
[B] Well and , uh , you know , one thing my wife and I 've talked about , i , are , uh , private schools .
[A] Yeah .
[B] You know whether , uh , uh , we would want to invest in , in private schools as they 're g , growing up , because , you know , just in the Dallas area , um , we 're not real comfortable with the , with the public schools .
-----
[A] And Dallas , uh , school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling .
[B] Right .
[A] I could n't believe that .
[B] Right .
[B] You know , one , that 's one reason we bought a house here in Plano .
-----
[B] We were hoping , you know , well the school district 's going to be good , you know , for resale value , and ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] so on and so forth ,
[B] but , uh , I can definitely , uh , see on down the road , you know , where we do have kids and are getting to that age , that 's going to be a definite concern .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] we talked , you talked about before , about the school funding .
[A] I think there 's only going to be one solution to school funding which I do n't think will be necessarily the best way
-----
[A] but I think what 's going to have to happen is there 's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids .
[A] That 's the only way they 're going to fund it , because if they start raising taxes for property , and people are going to throw a fit .
[B] That 's ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] and , you know , that 's ,
[B] taxes right now are political suicide .
[A] Oh , yeah .
-----
[B] You know ,
[B] and I do n't think any politician 's going to do that ,
[B] so .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] and the only thing , they , they would think of would be tuition , you know ,
[A] if it works at colleges it will work down below .
-----
[B] Right .
[A] And , you know , that 's going to , that 's going to affect the people that are having kids in school , of course , which is probably the only fair thing to do .
[A] But , it will be hard for those that people , that have , have in school because they have to pay out even more .
[B] Exactly .
[B] And , you know , it 's going to really hurt the , the middle class , uh , people , I think .
[A] Oh , yeah .
-----
[B] Because , uh , they 're the ones that will probably have to , to carry the brunt of the load .
[A] That 's right .
[B] So , uh ,
-----
[A] And most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and , and knives and everything ,
[A] I mean , good grief what 's MUMBLEx .
[B] Yeah
[B] now , that 's , that 's just unbelievable to me , you know .
-----
[A] I ca n't believe that .
[A] I mean when I was in junior high and high school that never happened .
[A] You never heard about that .
[B] Well yeah ,
[B] we did n't , we did n't even think about it , you know .
-----
[A] No .
[A] And now , you know , what do we have now .
[A] You know , got kids that , MUMBLEx either got a , you know , a Magnum gun school ,
[A] like good grief .
[B] R- , right .
-----
[A] I mean , I 'd , I 'd be afraid to be in school , I mean b , teaching , or even being a student
[A] and think what , what 's it going to be like for my , my youngest , an my oldest son , when he goes to school .
[A] What 's going to happen ?
[A] I mean I , I 'm afraid for him to go .
[B] Exactly ,
[B] right .
[A] But there again , you ca n't hold them back .
[B] Another reason , yo- ,
-----
[B] and you want to encourage them , you know , to , to be active and everything in school ,
[B] but , uh , you know , with all the peer pressure that 's going on , with all the negative things , it is , uh , it 's a tough environment to be growing up in .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] and lot tougher than it was when I was going to school ,
-----
[A] and that was ,
[A] well I was , I graduated high school in nineteen seventy-nine ,
[A] so .
[B] Okay .
[A] That was what , twelve years ago , I guess .
[B] Right .
[A] So , you know , it 's lot different now .
[A] And what 's it going to be like in another twelve years when my , uh , oldest son is in high school .
[B] That 's right ,
-----
[B] that 's right .
[A] I 'm afraid to , I 'm afraid to even think about it .
[B] That , yeah , that is a scary thought ,
[B] but , uh , I do n't know ,
[B] I , I guess what you have to do is just , uh , keep in , uh , you know , encouraging them and , and , uh , uh , try to be open with them , so that y- , you can deal with the problems as they come up .
-----
[A] That 's all you can do .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] and .
[A] You got to , you got to be your child 's best friend , I guess ,
[B] Right .
[A] even when they 're a teenager and they , you know are kind of standoffish ,
[A] still you got to be their best friend because when they 've got problems , who they going to go to , their friends that are dealing drugs , or , or your parents .
[B] Exactly .
[A] You know ,
[A] an , and if they go to their friends dealing drugs , they 're going to be in even worse shape .
[B] That 's right .
[A] And , and the schools do n't , do n't really encourage to stay away from that , you know ,
[A] the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war , etcetera , etcetera .
[A] They do n't teach them good values like drugs are bad .
[A] I , maybe I 'm wrong , because I have n't , you know , been in that kind of environment for a long time ,
[A] but ,
[B] Right .
[A] it just is amazing , you know ,
[A] need to teach them good values .
[B] That 's true ,
[B] that 's true ,
[B] and , uh .
[A] Of course , wh- , if I say this is a good value , someone else is going to stand up and say , oh no .
[A] And the A C L U is going to get after them and have a lawsuit .
[B] Right .
[A] Which is going to take twenty years to resolve , you know .
[B] Well and I think , uh , you touched on it , you know ,
[B] you 've got to start them at the home .
[A] Yeah .
[B] You know
[B] that 's where they , that 's where they get the , the deep rooted values
[B] and ,
[A] That 's all you can do .
-----
[B] and , and , uh , and that 's about right .
[B] Then you just have to hope and pray that , that everything , uh , works out , works out okay ,
[B] so .
[A] That 's right .
-----
[A] Well I got to be going ,
[A] so , uh .
[B] Okay ,
[B] well , hey , I appreciate the call .
[A] Nice talking to you today .
[B] You to .
-----
[A] Have a good life , uh .
