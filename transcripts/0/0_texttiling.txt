[A] Okay .
[A] Uh , first , um , I need to know , uh , how do you feel about , uh , about sending , uh , an elderly , uh , family member to a nursing home ?
[B] Well , of course , it 's , you know , it 's one of the last few things in the world you 'd ever want to do , you know . Unless it 's just , you know , really , you know , and , uh , for their , uh , you know , for their own good .
[A] Yes .
-----
[A] Yeah .
[B] I 'd be very very careful and , uh , you know , checking them out .
[B] Uh , our ,
[B] had t- , place my mother in a nursing home .
[B] She had a rather massive stroke about , uh , about --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- uh , eight months ago I guess .
[B] And , uh , we were , I was fortunate in that
[B] I was personally acquainted with the , uh , people who , uh , ran the nursing home in our little hometown .
[A] Yeah .
-----
[B] So , I was very comfortable , you know , in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it .
[B] But there 's ,
[B] well , I had an occasion for my mother-in-law who had fell and needed to be , you know , could not take care of herself anymore , was confined to a nursing home for a while
[B] that was really not a very good experience .
[B] Uh , it had to be done in a hurry .
[B] I mean , we did n't have , you know , like six months to check all of these places out .
[B] And it was really not , not very good , uh , deal .
[A] Yeah .
-----
[B] We were not really happy with ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] nursing home that we finally had .
[B] Fortunately , she only had to stay a few weeks
[B] and she was able to , to return to her apartment again .
[B] But it 's really a big , uh , big , uh ,
[A] Yeah .
-----
[B] decision as to , you know , when to do it .
[B] You know , is there something else we could have done , you know , in checking out all the places that , uh , might be available .
[B] Of course , you know , there 's not one on every corner ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] especially , you know , smaller areas ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] smaller towns .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Probably the hardest thing in , in my family , uh , my grandmother , she had to be put in a nursing home
[A] and , um , she had used the walker for , for quite some time , probably about six to nine months .
[A] And , um , she had a fall
[A] and , uh , finally , uh , she had Parkinson 's disease ,
[B] Oh .
-----
[A] and it got so much that she could not take care of her house .
[B] Right .
[A] Then she lived in an apartment
[A] and , uh , that was even harder --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- actually .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Because it was , you know , it was just a change of , change of location
[A] and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling .
[B] Yes .
-----
[A] I mean , she tr- , she had , she had children all across the United States --
[B] Uh-huh
[A] -- and , you know , she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children .
[B] Right .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , um , that was pretty heart-rending for her .
[B] I can imagine .
[A] I think when she finally came to the realization that , you know , no , I can not , I can not take care of myself .
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] That 's tough .
[B] That 's tough .
[A] Yeah .
[A] I mean , for somebody who is , you know , for most of their life has , has , uh , not just merely had a farm but had ten children --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- had a farm , ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And , you know , facing that situation , it 's , it 's quite a dilemma .
[B] Yes .
[A] I think ,
[B] my mother , excuse me .
[B] Go ahead .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Well , my , uh , my , uh ,
[A] probably one of the biggest decisions I think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision --
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] -- than just delegate it .
[A] I think that they , they had a great deal of , um ,
[A] all the brothers and sisters got together
[A] and they actually had a conference .
[B] That 's great .
[A] And , I mean , it was just , it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family , getting down together and doing that .
[B] That 's right .
[A] And , and just the children were involved in the decision , because it involved just them .
[B] Right .
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] And , you know , making that decision and then finding a place
[A] and everybody had duties --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- to perform .
[A] You know , whether it was just , you know , giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] of the decision making , you know ,
[B] Yep .
[A] like finding a proper nursing home .
[B] You were very ,
[A] And they ,
[B] fortunate .
[A] I know .
[A] They , and , well , they had , well , they had , they had seen it coming .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] So , so ,
[A] I mean , it ,
[A] I mean , I , I , I , I har- , I , I truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like ,
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] that for me .
[B] Uh-huh .
[B] Absolutely .
[B] Unfortunately , a lot of times it , responsibilities like that seem to fall to , you know , maybe one child in the whole family , you know .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Well , we , we ,
[B] And , uh , it 's usually not a very smooth ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] smooth thing .
[B] We were , I was lucky too that I only have one brother .
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] And , uh , fortunately , we agreed , you know , on exactly , you know , what we thought should be done .
[B] My mother also was very very independent .
[B] She had her own , still had her own little house and still driving her own car ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] at age eighty-three .
[B] We were lucky in , that in one respect in that after she had her stroke she was n't really , you know , really much aware of what was going on .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] That nursing home life would not have been , you know , anything of her choosing ,
[B] of course , she would , she would not have been happy there at all .
[A] Um .
-----
[B] But as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Well , with my , with my grandmother I think it was , it was such that , uh , that she did not have the problem with ,
[A] she was very well aware
[A] and her daughter came and visited her --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- at least her daughter ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] came and visited her and also her several grandchildren ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] came and visited her every day .
[B] That 's great .
[A] And I think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest ,
[A] um , I , I , I think it would be ,
[A] it was more of a relief --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- for her .
[B] Sure .
[A] And , um ,
[A] I mean , but she was truly , she was truly aware .
[A] I mean , I , I , I di- , I do n't know how I would , how I would deal if one of my parents came with , with Alzheimer 's .
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] or something like ,
[B] That would be tough .
[A] that which is , which is far more devastating .
[B] Yes .
[B] Absolutely .
[A] And , um , I , I , I think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it was n't necessarily , you know , like the quantity of care --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- but the quality of ,
[B] Yes .
[A] care .
[A] That the people that worked there --
[B] Right .
[A] -- were very --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- were very interested that , to make it as close a home environment ,
[B] Uh-huh .
-----
[A] as possible .
[B] Yes .
[B] It would ,
[A] I think , I think , I think , you know for myself I , I see that as probably the , the , what everything would hinge upon .
[B] Oh ,
[A] Is it ,
[A] how close is it to a home environment .
[B] Yes .
[B] That 's right .
[A] That 's the , that 's probably the major question .
[B] I think that great strides are being made nowadays in , in caring for the elderly , you know , in several , in a ,
[A] Yeah .
-----
[B] in a whole lot of areas .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Just people are , of course , populations getting older .
[A] Yeah .
[A] You know it 's , it 's interesting that , that a lot , the population of the United States is changing because , you know , uh , now that so many more minorities , where they have had extended families for such a long time .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Um , matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[A] It was n't ,
[B] true .
[A] But , I guess as we become more industrialized and more , you know , less in a rural situation --
[B] Yes , um .
[A] -- we , we do n't , we , we , we choose not to deal with the ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] extended family --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- because we feel it 's kind of cumbersome ,
[B] That 's right .
[A] when in reality it makes things much much easier .
[B] Sure .
[B] Absolutely .
[B] And ,
[B] people , things are scattered so much nowadays .
[A] Yeah .
[A] I , I , I think that perhaps , perhaps the extended family , you know , that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care .
[B] Yes .
[A] You know I mean , of course there , there comes other issues , you know , whether or not any of the grandparents whether we feel like are going to be a good , they 're going to be a good caretaker for our children .
[B] Yes ,
[A] But ,
[B] just because they 're grandparents .
[A] I mean they raised us after all .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Just because they 're grandparents that does n't automatically make them a good child carer .
[A] Yeah .
[A] But , uh , I , I , I think that , you know , we always , uh , I mean , I 've , I 've had a lot of good experiences with , uh , with many many people especially where they 've had , uh , extended family .
[A] And I , and I , I kind of see that , that , you know , perhaps , you know , we may need to like get close to the family environment and --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and get down to the values of , you know ,
[A] I mean , uh , it 's ,
[A] money seems to be too big of an issue .
[B] Oh , yeah .
[A] With ,
[B] sure .
[A] with , with ,
[B] realistically it is .
[A] with what 's going on today
[A] and I , I think , I think that we may not , that may be , you know , perhaps if we put money on the back burner --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- that may , that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problem .
[B] That would ,
[A] I mean ,
[B] certainly help .
[A] I mean we may not , we may not have as high a standard of living --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- but the qua- , but actually have a truer standard of living .
[B] Right .
[B] That 's just a matter of defining priorities , I guess --
[A] Yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- or some priorities anyway .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I think you 're right .
[A] Okay .
[A] Well , I guess that was it .
[B] Okay .
[B] It was good talking to you .
[A] Okay .
[B] Yeah .
[A] All right .
[B] Take care .
[A] Hey .
[B] Bye-bye .
[A] Bye-bye .
