[A] Okay ,
-----
[A] um , I guess , um , this is probably really a good subject for me because I really like to do , uh , hand work .
[A] Uh , mostly I do needlepoint , I guess .
[B] Oh really .
-----
[A] But , um ,
[B] What kinds of things have you done ?
[A] Um , well , I 've made a lot of baby gifts .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] It seem like that 's ,
-----
[A] like , especially lately there 's been so many babies , that , uh , bibs and blankets , and things like that . Wall hangings , um ,
[B] Do you ever keep any of your stuff ?
[A] Is n't that funny .
-----
[A] No .
[B] I do crochet and a lot of , uh , things like that ,
[B] and I have very little of my own stuff ,
[B] and it 's kind of embarrassing .
[B] People say let me see some of your work .
[B] Oh well , can you do it MUMBLEx ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] is n't that funny .
-----
[A] I guess I do have one thing .
[A] A friend of mine gave me a clock kit --
[B] Ooh .
[A] -- and , I , I needlepointed the face ,
[A] and I , uh , kept that because she gave me that .
[A] So ,
[B] That , that would be definitely something you 'd want to keep .
-----
[A] Oh , yeah .
[A] And it 's real neat .
[B] Was , was the whole face done or just the numbers , and , and , like minute marks ?
[A] Um , basically , the whole ,
-----
[A] well , no ,
[A] I guess the minute marks ,
[A] but the minute marks are done , they 're like hearts .
[B] Oh .
[A] And then the ,
[A] at the numbers they , they 're kind of outlined and stuff .
[A] It , it was quite bit of work ,
[A] but , you know , it was a lot of fun , too .
[A] I really like doing stuff like that .
[A] So .
[B] I did some needlepoint years ago ,
[B] and then I got into the Bargello .
[A] Oh , what 's that ?
[B] Well , it 's an Italian , um , needlework , using , using the uh ,
[B] I started to say the canvas ,
-----
[B] but the , uh , huh ,
[B] what kind of cloth uses that .
[B] I , I 've just gone blank .
[B] But it 's used with yarn ,
[B] and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth --
[A] Huh .
[B] -- and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors .
[B] Like it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you 're making a design like a geometric or whatever ,
[B] and it was used quite often in the colonial times to , uh , uh , to upholster chairs , and so forth , as well as the crewel , um , embroidery work that was done on them .
[A] Wow , that 's interesting .
[A] What did you , what kind of things did you do ?
[B] What I did , when I was doing that was mostly pillows , you know , for sofas and so forth ,
[B] and I ca n't find one that I 've done .
-----
[A] Oh .
[B] It 's one of those things
[B] I did , I did n't give them away ,
[B] but I did n't know if it 's been my color choice or multiple moves --
[A] Yeah ,
[B] -- or , or what ,
[B] and it ,
[B] I was so proud of them when I got them finished ,
[B] but I have no idea where they are .
[A] What did you call that ?
[B] Bargello .
[B] It 's B , A , R , G , E , double L , O
[A] Huh .
[A] That 's ,
[A] I 've never heard of that before .
[A] I 've probably seen it , though ,
[B] I suspect you ,
[A] I mean , when you described it .
[B] I suspect you have .
[A] Yeah .
[A] I mean , when you described it , it sounded like something , you know , that would be around , I guess .
[A] But , I 've never heard of it before ,
[A] and it 's really interesting .
[A] Um , I guess I 've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past ,
[A] but I 've kind of gotten out of that .
[A] I use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows .
[B] Me , too .
-----
[A] Really .
[B] Yes .
[B] That 's interesting .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it is .
[B] How did you know to choose this subject , tonight .
[B] That 's funny .
[B] What ,
[B] how did you ,
[B] what kinds of decorations did you use with the bas- ,
[B] how were you decorating the baskets ?
[A] Oh , basically bows and lace --
-----
[B] Um .
[A] -- uh , ribbons .
[A] Um . I really wanted to do ,
[A] you know , so many of them now have the ribbons where , I 'm not sure how they do it ,
[A] but the ribbons , they make them , they like .
[A] I do n't know how to explain it .
[A] They make them hard , you know ?
[B] Like fabric that 's been stiffened .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Yes .
[A] I 've never done that ,
[A] and those are so neat .
[A] I mean , I would really like to do those
-----
[B] I 've seen some ,
[B] and there , there , they ,
[B] I suspect they 're fairly simple , because the one lady I 've seen , I know that does it , I 've never asked her any questions ,
[B] but she has three kids all under the age of like six .
[B] And , and they 're all a handful .
[B] So it 's got to be something she can do fairly easily --
[A] Oh , definitely ,
[A] yeah .
[B] -- and fairly quickly .
[B] When I do , um , crochet , it 's usually the lacy Victorian type --
[A] Oh .
[B] -- things like that ,
[B] and I stiffen those with a , a glue mixture .
[B] It 's like white glue ,
[B] and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then , um , allowed to dry in those , those draping bows , I mean , those draping streamers .
[A] Oh .
[B] I do n't know .
[B] I was just .
-----
[B] There 's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that 's very similar --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- that 's not going to melt too much with , uh , uh , high humidity ,
[A] That 's --
[B] in a room ,
[A] -- I think that 's what my concern was , was it really sure , and how they would , how they would last .
[B] Do you know what my concern is ?
-----
[B] How will I dust this thing ?
[A] You 're right .
[B] That 's terrible .
-----
[A] No
[A] that 's true .
[A] That 's funny .
[B] So many of my crafts ,
[B] well , right now I 'm looking at a little quilted , uh , uh , hanging ,
[B] it 's , like , it 's a flag ,
[B] and I do n't want to wash it , because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth ,
[B] but it 's such a dust collector to be out , and so forth .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And most of my things are dust collectors .
[B] Uh , and I hate to dust .
[A] I know .
[B] So first thing I think of is how easy would this ,
[B] thing be to clean .
[A] That 's funny .
[A] No ,
[A] I do some ,
[A] I have really gotten out of it .
[A] I do n't do it quite as much as I used to . Um , I guess because I , I went back to school ,
-----
[A] so I do n't have as much time .
[B] Oh , you do n't have time .
[A] No ,
[A] and I have two children also .
-----
[B] You definitely do n't have time .
[A] It keeps me very busy .
[A] But I really enjoy it when I do do it , when I get the chance , you know .
-----
[A] It 's really ,
[A] it 's so relaxing to just sit ,
[A] and , but once I get started , I ca n't put it down .
[A] I just ,
[B] I have a similar problem .
-----
[B] I 've got to have time
[B] or I do n't even want to get into it in the first place .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And so I end up lots of time not doing anything at all .
[A] I know ,
[A] I started a project , it 's been over a year ago that I swore I was going to finish for somebody for Christmas .
-----
[B] You just did n't say which Christmas , right .
[A] That 's what I keep telling this person ,
[A] well , I did n't tell you what year .
-----
[B] What was this project ?
[A] Um , well , it 's a , it 's uh , cross stitch ,
[A] and it 's a picture ,
-----
[A] and it 's a wildlife ,
[A] it has deer and trees
[A] and , it 's really beautiful ,
[A] but it 's going to be a lot of work ,
[A] and you know , I 've , I have worked on it quite a bit , but not as much as I 'd like to .
[A] You know , it 's just so hard .
[B] Now this is done in the needlepoint ?
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Well , I should ,
[A] it 's counted cross stitch , actually , is what I 'm doing ,
-----
[A] and so it 's really , since it 's counted , you know , it 's really a lot of work .
[B] Yes .
[B] Yes ,
[B] I do know .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I have done a little bit of that ,
[B] but I decided that that 's something that demands my tim- , my , my total attention .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And so I 've got to have total , almost total silence .
[B] I ca n't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate .
[B] It sounds like you 'd have lots of shading --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- on that particular piece .
[A] Yep .
[B] It is not , does not sound like an easy one to finish .
[A] No ,
[A] it really is n't ,
-----
[A] and I tell you , really , I could just kick myself for even starting it , because I have a feeling I 'm never going to get it done .
[A] I 'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life .
[B] Oh , I 'm sure you 'll get it done ,
-----
[B] but it just may not of the original ,
[B] obviously not of the original time schedule .
[A] No ,
[A] that 's true .
-----
[A] I , I just do n't know when I 'm ever ,
[A] it just seems like there 's just never enough time to pick it up and do it ,
[A] you know , it 's just really hard .
[A] But I really do en ,
[A] like I said I really enjoy it when I do .
[A] It 's just hard .
[B] Just hard finding the time --
-----
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- that can be dedicated .
[A] And there 's , there 's so many other things that , I , I have done , you know , in the meantime , like I said , so many baby gifts .
[A] I 've made a lot of bibs , and wall hangings ,
-----
[A] and so , you know , those do n't take much time at all .
[A] So it 's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them .
[B] Do you , do you use patterns , I mean , like a book of patterns ,
-----
[B] or do you go out an buy a , a kit , like for a bib or something like that .
[A] No ,
[A] I usually just buy a pattern book .
[A] I have several pattern books ,
-----
[A] and I just go with those .
[B] Okay .
[A] And then I buy the bibs separate .
[A] Usually I think it 's a little bit cheaper in the long run ,
[A] and then I just use whatever colors I want to .
[A] I do n't usually use the colors they tell me to .
[B] Um .
[A] And it , it depends on what it is , you know .
[A] But some things , especially letters , if they suggest certain colors for letters , I just go with whatever I want to .
[B] That 's what I would do , too .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[B] Or whatever I have .
[A] There 's yeah , there 's a few designs I guess I 've done myself , but not very many .
[A] Real simple ones , you know , I do .
[A] I 've made , I made a little , uh , little , uh , little thumb print and made it a bunny .
[B] Ooh .
[A] It was really easy .
[A] I mean , just , just did a thumb print . You know .
[B] What . With ink ?
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] And then , see I did n't cross stitch the actual thumb print ,
-----
[A] you know , that was just the ink ,
[A] and then I made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth .
[A] That was so simple .
[B] Oh , that sounds really neat .
-----
[A] It did n't take anything at all .
[B] Did you do , did you use , like , uh , a stamp pad --
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] And then I just ,
[B] -- and ink .
-----
[B] Ok
[B] so you ,
[B] just like being finger printed ...
