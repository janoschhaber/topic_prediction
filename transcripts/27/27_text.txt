[A] Hello .
[B] Hello there .
[A] Did I reach the Dallas area ?
[B] I beg your pardon ?
[A] Did I reach the Dallas area ?
[B] No ,
[B] you 've reached Dayton , Ohio .
[A] Dayton , Ohio ,
[A] I 'm from North Carolina .
[B] Oh , you 're from North Carolina .
[B] Where in North Carolina ?
[A] In Raleigh .
[B] Raleigh ,
[B] great .
[A] Yeah ,
[B] Well , my name 's Mary .
[A] My name is Fernando .
[B] Fernando , glad to know you .
[A] So , um , do you , well ,
[A] how 'd you find out about this ?
[B] Uh , I was visiting my son down in Dallas ,
[B] and .
[A] Oh , okay ,
[A] he works for T I .
[B] No ,
[B] no ,
[B] but his wife has a contract with T I ,
[B] and that 's how we learned about it ,
[B] uh-huh .
[A] Oh , okay ,
[A] because I 'm down at N C State .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] uh-huh .
[A] And so I took a class ,
[A] and he said , sign up and get some money --
[B] Right .
[A] -- and just talk for five minutes .
[A] So are you ready ?
[B] I 'm ready .
[A] Okay ,
[A] let 's get started .
[B] All right ,
[B] okay .
[A] Okay ,
[A] so , uh , what do you think , that , uh ,
[A] what do , what do , what do you think we can do to solve the crime in America ?
[B] Oh , if I knew that I 'd be a very wealthy person .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] but what , what , what are the steps ?
[B] Well , you have to see ,
[B] I , the way I look at it , you have to think first of all why ,
[B] or ha , has crime increased ,
[B] and if so , why has crime increased ?
[A] Well , see the problem is , is that , um , what happens is as , that you 're , uh , you know , as you go from the country to a city , crime always increases , right ?
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Because in the country , people still respect , uh , the property of other people .
[B] Right .
[A] And so , as , as ,
[A] and the people in the country do n't want as much as the people in the city .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Now what happens is all those that do n't have any money in the country move to the cities ,
[A] and they rush to get the same thing .
[A] They say , why ca n't we have the same things that these other people have ,
[A] and the thing that we can do is , we need money for drugs ,
[A] and what we have to do is , we have to go , uh , get some stuff , steal it , and then , you know , just resell it .
[B] It 's easy ,
[B] you said the magic word there .
[A] Which one ?
[B] Drugs .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased .
[A] That 's , uh , that 's , uh , the main reason I think , uh , everywhere
[A] because , uh , you have deaths .
[A] I mean , I mean , you have murders
[A] and you have , you know , people stealing other people 's stuff ,
[A] and that 's
[A] a lot of it has to do with drugs .
[B] Oh , yes .
[A] It does n't have to do ,
[A] I mean , the thing is is that , you know , it 's like you might be standing somewhere , right ,
[A] and like let 's say you , you 're , you 're , you know , you 're driving out
[A] and you 're driving back home
[A] and it 's late at night .
[A] And you stop by one of these , you know , twenty-four hour , you know , gas stations joints .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And , uh , somebody walks in there with a gun .
[A] I mean , they 're going to want the money ,
[A] and you can tell by the people who are always caught , that these people are there to get money for drugs .
[A] I mean , they do n't want the money so , uh , so they can do something else with it .
[B] No ,
[B] they do n't want the money for food ,
[B] that 's for sure .
[A] Right ,
[A] right ,
[A] and so .
[B] Well , but you know , the , the strange thing , uh , perhaps , not strange , but something that many people do n't realize , is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids ,
[B] because , uh , I 'm a retired educator .
[A] Okay .
[B] And , in fifty-one and fifty-two , the police came to the high school where I was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs , how to recognize the pushers --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- outside the one entrance , that they were giving their drugs away in order to get the kids started , and so on , and so on .
[B] So it 's a problem that 's been around for over forty years ,
[B] and we 're just really , uh , uh , now , trying to , uh , figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] there 's a , there 's a , uh , a song that I know which says , you know , tha- ,
[A] it 's like , in , uh , nineteen eighty-eight , nineteen eighty-nine , the local , state , and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in America ,
[A] and , uh , their figures , I think are too , so
[A] I mean it 's like , compared to , you know , compared to , weapons or stuff like that , I mean , you 're spending nothing on , on crime in the country itself .
[A] What you 're doing is , you , you know ,
[A] it 's like , you have other things , you know ,
[A] you have the AIDS
[A] we 're going to solve , try to solve --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- the AIDS problem while , while , you know , some people are getting killed here and there
[A] and then .
[B] Yeah
[B] and another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers , the big dealers in drugs ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] may be , may be part of the power structure that 's keeping us from spending the money in that direction .
[A] But those people never get caught .
[A] The people that --
[B] That 's right ,
[B] they 'll never get caught .
[A] -- that , that I ,
[A] see , their theory is that if I 'm surrounded , and I 'm going to be caught , I 'm going to try to find my way through ,
[A] and they 're not going to take me alive .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] But I have such a big army outside of my place , that nobody can touch me .
[B] That 's right .
[B] But they 'll ,
[A] You know , it 's like ,
[A] of course , I mean I might be , you know , the the leading drug dealer here ,
[A] but you wo n't find me dealing in drugs ,
[A] I mean , there 's no connection --
[B] That 's right .
[A] -- between me and the people that were caught , you know .
[B] That 's right ,
[B] and , they ,
[B] one person does n't know the other person down the line .
[A] Right .
[B] But the guy at the very top , the one who 's , who 's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure , uh , the , uh , and had the political --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- uh , pull to keep things from , uh , keep the interest or the emphasis in some other direction , other than on the drug dealing ,
[B] because it sure is monstrous in this country .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I was , I was at a , at a party on Saturday ,
[A] and this guy comes over ,
[A] he goes , hey , how you doing , MUMBLEx
[A] he started talking to me ,
[A] and this guy was from Jamaica , right .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And he 's got his little brother selling drugs .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] You know , and he goes , yeah , I just came up here to work ,
[A] and I go , oh you did , MUMBLEx you make very good money up here .
[A] He goes , yeah , I make a lot , a lot of money ,
[A] he goes , you know .
[A] And , uh , in the movie GOOD FELLOWS .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] might .
[A] Did you see it ?
[B] Nope ,
[B] I only heard about it .
[A] Okay ,
[A] in one part , the guy goes out of jail ,
[A] and within , uh , two months , he has all his house payments gone --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- everything paid , you know ,
[A] and he had enough money to , you know ,
[A] it 's like , those guys , at one point , you know , they had so much money that they did n't know what to do with it .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] really , you know ,
[B] even in our prison systems they 're finding that they 're , they 're having drugs smuggled into them .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] that 's , that , that was also in the movie .
[B] Right .
[A] Yeah .
[A] So hello Mary .
[B] Been nice talking with you .
[A] We 've been talking for five minutes ?
[B] I beg your ,
