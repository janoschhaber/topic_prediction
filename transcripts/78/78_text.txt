[A] Okay ,
[A] so what kind of movies have you seen , lately , I guess ?
[B] Um , a lot ,
[B] well , the last movie I saw , but it was n't my choice , was the NINJA TURTLE movie .
[A] Obviously you have kids .
[B] That 's right .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] but my preference is the one we saw before that was SILENCE OF THE LAMBS .
[A] I have n't seen that one yet .
[B] That 's an excellent movie .
[A] Um , the last movie I saw was , uh , SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY .
[B] Oh , was that good .
[B] I heard ,
[A] Uh , see , I 'm not a big Julie Roberts fan .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] But I was a lot , I was a lot more impressed with her than I thought I would be .
[B] Well , that 's good .
[A] It turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it was a pretty good movie .
[B] SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat .
[A] I , I 'm ready to go .
[A] It just ,
[A] it 's , you know , has n't worked out that way yet .
[B] Right .
[A] You know , it 's , uh , it looks good , you know --
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it is .
[A] -- if you like thrillers , anyway .
[B] Right .
[B] And I do .
[A] In fact , people I 've talked to said that they had n't slept real good for a while afterwards .
[A] So ,
[B] Really .
[B] Oh , I love them like that .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I 'm not ,
[B] I mean , I , I like all ranges of movies ,
[B] but I like that where they run tense .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I really enjoy ,
[B] they keep me guessing the whole time .
[B] It 's really , it was really interesting .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Well , what other movies have you seen then lately ?
[B] Oh .
[A] Other than the ,
[A] I assume you were talking about the new NINJA TURTLES .
[B] Yes ,
[B] the new one , of course .
[A] Is that any good ,
[A] I mean , I 'm sure I 'm going to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister lives , and she 's got two boys that I took to see the first one .
[B] Oh .
[A] So I 'm sure I 'm going to see the next one here real soon .
[B] Amarillo .
[B] I did n't see the first one .
[B] My husband said it was , um , about the same lines .
[A] Oh , well , then it wo n't be too bad .
[B] So , yeah .
[A] You know , it was n't impressive necessarily ,
[A] but it was better than it could have been .
[B] Right ,
[B] right .
[B] And I was impressed with the fact that , um , it was n't that childish .
[A] Yeah .
[B] You know what I mean .
[B] It was n't ,
[B] my daughter 's five ,
[B] I mean she understood everything .
[B] She goes to almost all movies with us except , you know , R rated .
[B] And she really enjoyed it ,
[B] but it was on a higher level , you know , where there were some things that kids did n't understand that adults did ,
[B] and I liked that .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I think that 's important if you 're going , you know , if you 're going , uh , kids are going to , uh , parents are going to have to go --
[B] Right .
[A] -- you ought to make it at least semi- ,
[A] you know , semi for them too .
[B] That 's right ,
[B] that 's right .
[A] Yeah .
[B] It 's pretty good .
[B] But we take her to just about every movie ,
[B] and , she , uh , she does really good .
[B] We 've taken her from real young ,
[B] and she does real good .
[B] Like I said , we do n't take her to R -s .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] So , if and when we ever get a baby-sitter , like we did with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS , we go see it .
[A] I 's about to say , you 're not going to take her to that one , I 'm sure .
[B] Oh , no ,
[B] no .
[A] Do you take her , or do you go to a lot of comedy movies
[A] or to ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] What was the last comedy you saw ?
[B] Oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw ?
[B] Huh , huh , huh . Good question ,
[B] good question .
[B] We do n't get to go that often ,
[B] but something on the tip of my tongue ,
[B] and I ca n't think of which one it was .
[B] Uh . Gosh , I ca n't remember .
[A] The last , uh ,
[A] in fact I guess this was the last movie I saw --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- I said that wrong ,
[A] the last movie I saw was THE HARD WAY with Michael J . Fox .
[B] But that , that sounds good .
[A] Well , that really was n't too bad .
[A] There were ,
[A] you know , he 's supposed ,
[A] you know , he 's this actor , right --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and he 's playing a cop .
[B] Right .
[A] Or he 's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff .
[A] I think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] I mean , there , there were times when he was , like , he 'd be running with a gun or whatever .
[A] He did n't look like a cop when he did it .
[A] And I was so --
[B] That 's neat .
[A] -- impressed with that because , you know , usually ,
[B] The part was hard , to do that .
[A] Oh yeah ,
[A] because , I mean , everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to , you know , to imitate them or whatever .
[B] Right .
[A] And , uh , I thought he did such an excellent job of not --
[B] Yeah ,
[A] -- going that far .
[A] Now , by the end he was looking more like a cop .
[B] Right .
[A] But at the beginning of the movie and all through the middle part , you know , he was trying to , trying to get it ,
[A] but he was n't there yet .
[B] Right .
[A] And you could tell it ,
[A] and I guess that I thought was a real good acting and writing job both , you know , because I think , or directing job .
[A] I think they did a real good job of that .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And James Woods , I think is who it was , did an excellent job as the cop .
[A] I mean , you know , he just ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I like him .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] and there were , there were some definite , um , should I say , tense moments ,
[A] with him in there .
[B] Probably the last comedy we saw , now that I think about it , is HOME ALONE .
[A] Yes ,
[A] I , I , I had seen it before Christmas ,
[A] but I took a date to it , uh , about a month ago .
[A] So , I , I , I 've seen it the second time not too long ago .
[A] So .
[B] It was really cute .
[A] I really enjoyed it .
[A] Of course , the bad thing about it was , uh , the second time I saw it , I did n't really enjoy it as much ,
[A] and I was kind of surprised at that .
[A] I thought that would be one of those that I would love to watch over and over .
[B] Yeah .
[A] But before ,
[A] maybe it 's just the idea of my reaction to the first time . I had laughed so hard I was hoarse .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] uh-huh .
[A] I really was , I was hoarse getting out of there .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And maybe I just laughed so hard the first time that I did n't have it ,
[A] I mean , it just was n't as funny the second time --
[B] Right .
[A] -- because I had just gone overboard the first time .
[A] I do n't know
[A] but ,
[B] Maybe so ,
[B] maybe so .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I mean , it was , it was a great movie though .
[A] I loved the movie .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I did , too .
[B] I 'm looking forward to this summer , uh , NAKED GUN TWO AND A HALF is coming out .
[A] I love those movies .
[B] I do too .
[B] I mean , they are just slapstick .
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] It ,
[B] you have to see those twice to catch everything .
[A] Well , you have to see them more than that .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] I , I , I still catch things in AIRPLANE that I did n't catch .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I mean , it 's amazing --
[B] I do too .
[A] -- I love those movies --
[B] I do too .
[A] -- I really do .
[B] So I 'm looking forward to seeing that --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- because that looks hilarious ,
[B] as they all do .
[A] Oh yeah .
[B] Well , we , we try to go a couple times a month , I guess --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- to see a movie .
[B] It , it 's just getting so expensive .
[A] Oh , is n't it though .
[A] You know , but that 's at least the good thing about the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper .
[B] But normally we do n't think about it until ,
[A] That 's exactly what ,
[A] I was going to say .
[A] I keep not doing it until after I 'm there
[A] and then all of a sudden I 'm saying I wish I 'd bought these things .
[B] I know , because we can go spend fifteen dollars --
[A] Easily .
[B] -- just getting in --
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah ,
[B] -- the three of us .
[A] And then if you want popcorn and stuff --
[B] Yeah .
[B] I do n't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both .
[B] You know popcorn is not that expensive .
[A] No ,
[A] nowhere near that expensive .
[B] So they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke .
[A] And , it , it 's just the idea that these , uh , these actors , you know , live in such lavish style .
[A] I mean , it 's as simple as that .
[B] Yeah .
[B] We just keep breeding them .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] and as long as we keep paying the money for it , they are going to keep paying them .
[B] I guess so .
[B] Now have you seen DANCES WITH WOLVES ?
[A] Yes .
[A] Oh yeah .
[A] Oh , that was , that was an excellent movie .
[B] I have n't seen ,
[B] we 're waiting for the video .
[A] No ,
[A] do n't .
[B] No ,
[B] really ?
[A] Do n't .
[A] That needs the big screen .
[B] Oh .
[A] It really and truly does , because to get the feeling --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- of like when the buffalos are , when they 're chasing the buffalos and everything --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- you 've got to be where you feel it .
[B] Oh really ?
[A] You really truly do .
[B] Oh .
[A] I would ,
[A] I mean , I guess my first instinct was to wait for the video , too .
[A] But I 'm glad I did n't .
[A] I really and truly am .
[A] I mean , that mov- , that was one movie I came out impressed .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I really and truly did .
[A] I mean , I have absolutely no problems with them winning seven Oscars .
[A] None at all .
[B] Right .
[A] Normally I 'm one of these people that I do n't like one , one movie taking all the honors .
[B] Everythin- ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] I wanted him to win best actor on top of it ,
[A] he was ,
[B] Yeah , oh .
[A] Like I said , I would n't given the supporting actresses either one .
[B] Yeah .
[A] But even though they were okay , the girl in it ,
[A] they ,
[A] somebody made an interesting observation ,
[A] now that I think back on it , I 'd say yeah , I ca n't believe that either .
[A] She was the only indian to have her hair done at all times .
[A] You know what I mean , you know .
[A] It was just too perfect at all times .
[B] Yeah .
[A] That was a mistake that they made .
[A] They should n't have done it .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Now the best ,
[A] the supporting actor , he was good ,
[A] but from what I heard , the guy who got it was better ,
[A] so I , you know , I can see that .
[B] Yeah .
[A] But , oh ,
[B] You think my daughter would like it ?
[A] Oh , well there are , there is one spot that was just a little bit on the gory side .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] But , um , it 's it 's
[B] She does n't mind when we cover up her eyes .
[A] Okay ,
[A] no problems .
[A] It , it 's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide , the hides .
[A] So there 's ,
[B] See , that 's the one , that is the honest to God the one reason I do n't want to see the movie --
[A] Yeah ,
[A] but , well ,
[B] -- is because I love buffalos for some weird reason ,
[B] and I know they 're fake .
[A] And , and , of course ,
[A] and , well , yeah ,
[A] that , and plus , I mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt .
[A] So , I mean , they are killing buffalos in it .
[A] But they do n't stress that very much ,
[A] they really do n't .
[B] Okay ,
[B] okay .
[A] And I think it 's an excellent movie for ,
[A] if , if she enjoys movies I think it 'll work pretty good .
[B] Oh , that 'll be good .
[B] We really need some ,
[B] my husband keeps wanting to .
[A] It 's , it 's , it 's a long movie .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] and I heard the video 's even going to be longer .
[A] Oh yeah .
[B] They did a lot of stuff that they cut out .
[A] I may have to see the video .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] MUMBLEx that 's true ,
[B] they said ,
[A] I had n't even thought of that .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] they said there 's a lot that had been edited , because of the length --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and that they wanted in ,
[B] so they 're going to put it in the video .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And that way you can watch it at your leisure .
[A] Well , yeah ,
[A] I kind of like it when they do that , because the video , like I said ,
[A] there are certain things you ca n't do with a video --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- and the idea that they may put a little extra in it I think is a good idea .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] Because I mean when you rent a video ,
[A] videos , of course , are not cheap either --
[B] True .
[A] -- and so the idea of getting a little extra with it I think is a good idea . Because they , they make bundles of money off those things .
[B] I know it .
[B] Is n't that ridiculous .
[B] We have cable which --
[A] Oh , I do too .
[B] -- helps a lot .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] but not enough .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] we keep holding out , you know .
[A] Yeah
[A] I 'm getting to the point where , you know , I watch , well I watch NICK AT NIGHT .
