[A] Well , since you live close , I do n't know if you know , um , about what Louisville is doing with recycling ,
[A] or are you familiar with any of that ?
[B] Well , I know that we have some relatives that live around , like the MUMBLEx area in there ,
[A] Huh-uh .
[B] I know they 're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there .
[A] Yeah .
[A] You know , I read , you know ,
[A] when they first started doing that in the paper , and I read about that ,
[A] I was just praying that , that would be in our area , because we 've been recycling for quite some time .
[A] And , you know , we separate everything out , and then have to haul it up to a Metco ,
[B] Huh-uh .
-----
[A] you know , which is a real pain .
[A] So if they would come up ,
[B] they 'll help you ,
[A] curbside recycling ,
[B] recycle , because we , there is some bins , like behind Wal-Mart , that take some things .
[A] Well , now have they moved them behind Wal-Mart ?
[B] Yeah .
[A] Oh , God .
[B] Because I finally asked because , you know , we had all of those milk cartons
[B] and there was nowhere else to take them
[B] and they had it in front of Wal-Mart
[B] and I ask in Wal-Mart
[B] and they said they moved it just behind .
[A] Oh .
-----
[A] That 's really nice to know , because we were doing the same thing .
[A] Because to take it to a Metco , you have to take it when they 're open , you know ,
[B] Huh-uh .
[A] which is always a real pain .
[A] And so when that thing came up in Wal-Mart parking lot , we thought , oh , this is great .
[A] And we started taking them up there .
[A] And then , all the sudden , it disappeared , you know .
[A] I did n't know .
[A] And we 're going , oh , no , there goes our recycling place .
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] That 's really nice to find out that it 's behind there .
[A] Well , we pretty much do , um , plastic milk cartons and , um , um , um , newspapers .
[A] I could n't even think of what you call them .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Plastic milk cartons , newspapers and cans , and glass , I guess , is the four , is really the four things that we do .
[B] Like aluminum cans ?
-----
[A] Yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[B] That 's about what we do too .
[A] And really , that 's about , that 's really about it .
[A] Is there anything , any place else that really takes anything other than that , that you know of ?
[B] Well , I guess , um , down in , kind of in North Dallas , there is a place that will take almost anything .
[A] Oh , really .
-----
[B] Uh , I do n't , we just do n't have the room to store all that much , you know ,
[A] I know .
[B] I do n't want to be running down there every week ,
[A] I know .
[A] I know .
[B] or whatever .
[A] We 're kind of the same way .
[A] You know , at first , you know , you ,
[A] at first it was a real , it was a real hassle ,
[A] and I 'm wondering are we really going to do this ,
[A] but you kind of get , I guess , into a little routine , you know , where it becomes , is automatic , now , to throw ,
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] different things in different places ,
[A] you know . So I just go , you know ,
[A] we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen
[A] and I 've just got three trash cans sitting in there ,
[A] you know , we just kind of dump things in each one , if , you know ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] if we get them ,
[A] so .
[B] Those milk cartons take up so much room .
[A] Oh , they do , too .
[A] And they 're impossible to crush .
[A] I mean , you ca n't get the down to any size , you know .
[A] If you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag , you know pretty easily ,
[A] so . You know ,
[B] I guess we kind of started recycling after I moved here about a year and a half ago .
[A] Oh , really .
[B] We were using baby food
[B] and there was so many baby food jars ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] kind of what started it .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Some of our neighbors were doing it
[B] and so , you know , when I found out some places to take it ,
[B] and , um , like , um , they also take some things at the Flower Mound dump behind the fire station there ,
[B] and I know that they 're going to use , you know , the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing .
[A] Oh , that will be good .
[B] Put lights and stuff
[B] so , you know , if I 'm not going to get the money for aluminum , I would just assume give it to the city of Flower Mound .
[A] Sure .
[B] to do something with , you know .
[A] Let somebody get something out of it .
[B] Yeah .
[B] That 's true .
[B] And they wo n't raise our taxes .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Ha-ha .
[A] Well , I was kind of hoping with ,
[A] you know , do you work for T I ?
[B] No ,
[B] I do n't .
[B] I have a friend ,
[A] No .
[B] of mine told me about this program , is the reason that I 'm ,
[A] Yeah .
[A] There was a ,
[A] T I has got this organization called T A D which is T I'ers Against Drugs .
[A] And , you know , we 're recycling aluminum cans up here and , uh , just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here
[A] and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know ,
[A] and that 's ,
[A] they use the money from that to fund this T I'ers Against Drugs Program .
[A] It 's ,
[A] you know , T I does n't give them any money , all , everything is made from that .
[A] And they had talked about having a thing like , one Saturday a month , you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home , you know ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] And I 'm kind of like , yeah .
[A] I shall ,
[A] they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it , you know . That was going to use it for good ,
[A] so ,
[B] Sorry .
[A] Sounds like you have a little one just like I do .
[B] She 'll be two in July .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Mine was two in December .
[B] Oh .
[A] Well , it was good to talk to you .
[B] Well , it was nice to talk to you .
[B] I know they 've started over in Richardson where my dad lives .
[B] They pick up newspapers , I think .
[A] Oh , do they really .
[A] Curbside pick up ?
[B] Yeah .
[A] I really hope they do that in Louisville .
[A] It would make it a lot easier on all of us .
[B] MUMBLEx .
[A] Talk to you later .
[B] Okay .
[A] Bye-bye .
