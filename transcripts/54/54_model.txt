[A] It 's , it 's hard topic because
-----
[A] is , is , is it doing a good job or a bad job
[A] and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like I do .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] and are you talking about public schools being lower level , high school level or --
-----
[A] Well , public school all the way up --
[B] -- state school .
[A] -- kindergarten all the way up to , uh , uh , high school .
[B] Okay ,
[B] but you 're excluding high-level education .
[A] Yes ,
[A] well , yeah
-----
[A] I am . Oh ,
[B] Okay .
[A] A- , actually I think that , I , higher level education ,
[A] I do n't think there 's so much of a problem there .
[A] It 's pretty much funded well .
[A] There are small colleges that I 'm sure are struggling
[A] but , uh , it 's the job that the , the high school and the grade schools are doing that I see , in a area like ours ,
[A] our school ,
[A] even a bad school is a good school up here , where , if I lived in New York City or Washington , D C , uh , I would seriously consider moving if I had a child .
[A] I would n't let them go to a public school system there .
[A] But , of course , people are trapped economically
[A] and they ca n't do that .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I know down here the schools are , you know ,
[B] I do n't know ,
-----
[B] they rate ,
[B] I moved to Arkansas and Texas after living in Ohio
[B] and the schools down here rate , you know , bottom ten percent across the country
[B] and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school I can understand why .
[B] Because they 're so far behind and so poorly staffed , half the time the teachers do n't know what 's going on .
[A] Well , that 's really too bad because it , it 's giving some people unfair advantage .
-----
[A] I mean we , our high school up here is like a junior college in Florida --
[B] Right .
[A] -- what we learned .
[B] Well , that was my experience going through junior high up there
-----
[B] when I came down south for high school I was just repeating what I 'd already done .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Because we were so far advanced .
[B] And , uh , you know , I 'd been in a parochial school before junior high
[B] and , you know , even the public schools are behind the parochial schools .
[A] Yeah .
[B] So , you know , I , I like the concept they 've got now where they have more directed education , you know ,
[B] you , you pick a career path
[B] or you get counseling earlier
[B] and then you , you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over .
[A] Like they have that down there that ,
[B] Well , they talk about it
-----
[B] and there are a few in some of the more , like in
[B] I live in a big Metroplex
[B] and some of the , the better parts of the Metroplex , the , the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools .
[B] But , uh , you know ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it 's like if , if your father owns a grocery store and you 're really interested in that ,
[A] there 's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some --
[B] Right .
[A] -- general business courses in high school .
[B] Or if you 're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art .
-----
[B] You know , there 's no point in , you know ,
[B] I 'm an engineering student
[B] and if I have to go take art classes , you know , I 'm not going to use them .
[B] And through high school I could have gone so much further if I 'd gone to a school that was directed .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's true .
[A] I was fortunate .
[A] I 'm a , I 'm a technician
[A] and we had a vocational , uh , electronics in our high school .
[B] Right ,
[B] in high school .
-----
[A] So when I went to my first year of tech school , I had a very easy time because our high school --
[B] Right .
[A] -- had a , a good program .
[B] I think the schools today , you know , the public schools are just , they 're just overrun , you know ,
[B] they do n't know what to do ,
[B] there 's too many kids and not enough teachers
[B] and too many of the kids do n't care .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I find that --
[B] And ,
[A] -- that the , that in the , in the cities , it 's more like the kids go there so socialize --
[B] Right .
[A] -- not really to learn
[A] and the parents send them there because they 're supposed to ,
[A] and plus it gets them out of their hair .
[A] And I also find that , that you can send a kid to school ,
[A] but if do n't work with them as a parent , I think you 're putting your child at a big disadvantage .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] and , you know , there 's some kids that , you know , want to go learn ,
[B] but most of them just want to go play .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] well I could , I could see if a kid does n't have any encouragement if , t- , they 're , you know , come from a broken home and their parents are more concerned about trying to work
[A] and , or maybe they 're unemployed
-----
[A] and they 're mad at the world ,
[A] I can see where that would n't be very good for a , a kid , you know ,
[A] he 's coming up , will you help me with my homework
[A] and they 're , no , get away from me ,
[A] I 've had a terrible day .
[A] So , it 's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's true .
[B] I 'm wondering with the boom down here .
[B] It 's , well , not at the moment ,
[B] but a lot of the industry 's moving southward .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] are they going to move to , uh --
[B] So ,
[A] -- Mexico ?
[B] Uh , I do n't know about that ,
[B] but a lot of the industry up in , uh , you know , the northern states is moving south --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and I 'm wondering if that 's going to have any effect , you know , on what you see now .
[B] We 're , we 're , we 're behind down here .
[A] On the ,
-----
[B] I say we because I live here .
[B] If
[B] that might not turn around in the next , you know , fifteen , twenty years .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] maybe the , maybe they 'll bring their good schools with them . You know ,
[A] if the industry comes --
-----
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- hopefully they 'll promote good schools .
[A] Because I know the town that I come from the , the , uh , the large I B M plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one
[A] and plus for , for the type of student that 's going to that school , it 's going to raise the level of the school --
[B] Right .
[A] -- because your parents are engineers or chemists .
[A] They 're , they 're , you 're most likely to do better in school .
[A] They 're going to help you .
[B] You hope .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] you hope .
-----
[A] Well , I think ,
[A] I , I do n't know .
[A] I just think it , it 's , it 's a duty of the parent to do that .
[A] I mean , jeez , my parents always helped me
[A] and , I do n't know ,
[A] it 's just like you say ,
[A] it 's the way you 're raised and the economic situation you 're in .
[A] I can see some lady ,
[A] she 's twenty-one years old
[A] and she 's got four kids .
[A] A kid in ,
[A] her first grader ,
[A] I do n't see where she 's going to have much time for them .
[A] So , I do n't know .
[A] It 's just like ,
[B] I guess you just have to wonder ,
[B] is it up to the ,
-----
[B] is it , you know ,
[B] who , who 's supposed to make the change , the , the state , the govern- , the federal government , you know ,
[B] where 's the money supposed to come from .
[B] Is it , you know --
[A] I do n't know .
[A] Actually , I think it 's , I think it should be --
[B] -- what , what do you advocate , more taxes or better management of what they got ?
[A] -- a civic level , the city level and a , a system level really to find out , and t- , to see what they need and not overinflate it ,
-----
[A] like , if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back , and you 're getting --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- raises every eighteen months you got to go now , hey , wait a minute ,
[A] we 're in a recession here .
[A] We , uh , our town did n't pass the school budget this year and for the first time in many , many years just because people are , are in the recession
[A] and they 're ,
[A] even though we 've , uh , enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years ,
[A] now we got eight percent , uh , unemployment when it used to be four or five .
[A] People are going , whoa .
[B] Yeah .
[A] So ,
[B] Starts hitting closer to home .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] but I always , see it 's all , it 's all money .
[A] This ,
[A] like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime .
[A] It , it 's , it 's all money based .
[A] And what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level
[A] and , and then if you 're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school .
[A] Who knows ,
[A] bu- ,
[A] maybe we do , we need some more Catholic schools ,
[A] support the church instead .
[A] They seem to have done a , the good job in the past .
[A] In , uh , some places , uh , you could n't go to a public school .
[A] It was miles down the road
[A] and the only school you could go to was the Baptist school or the Catholic school
[A] so ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] they 're a lot more strict .
[A] Yeah
[A] I do n't ,
-----
[B] You , uh , have to learn ,
[B] you are n't given the chance to , you know , screw off all the time .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I do n't know if I would do that to my child , though .
-----
[A] But , so , pretty much , though ,
[A] see , I do n't have any good ideas or , or anything that would contribute .
[A] See , this is n't a subject that I think a lot about because I 'm never faced with it because our school system in Vermont , it seems to do a really good job .
[B] Well , I know I 'm in the , you know ,
-----
[B] the only reason I asked about secondary schools or , you know , advanced education is because down here , you know , going to the University of Texas , the education I 'm getting I think is kind of shoddy for a public school .
[A] Is it ?
[B] I , I do n't think I 'm getting what I should ,
-----
[B] but , you know , in Texas , it 's next to free because th- , they pay so much of it .
[B] It 's state supported .
[A] Well that ,
-----
[B] But at the same time it 's really not , it 's not like going to M I T .
[B] My engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of M I T .
[B] And that 's , it 's really too bad --
[A] Well ,
[B] -- but that 's ,
[B] I do n't know ,
[B] I think it just builds on the foundation that they 've already built .
[B] You get people out of high schools and col- , junior colleges that do n't have the background for an M I T kind of curriculum .
[B] So ,
[A] So you have to go to a lesser engineering school .
[A] We have a very good public school up here
-----
[A] and a degree out there means a lot .
[A] It 's a very good school .
[A] It 's , it 's University of Vermont .
[A] Uh , we also have some two year college .
[A] Well , there 's a four year colleges .
[A] They all have a pretty good reputation .
[A] But , like you say , you ,
