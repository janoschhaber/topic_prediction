[B] Okay .
[A] All right .
[B] Um , I , I understand that it 's being proposed as a requirement ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] for , uh , young people to be , to go into public service .
[B] I think ,
[A] Yes ,
[A] all , all young Americans , they did not specify , you know , exactly what young means .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[B] I think that it probably would be a , a good program .
[B] I think probably two years is too long .
[A] Yeah .
[B] I think maybe a year would be ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] the longest .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] you 're prob- , probably right ,
[A] two years might be a little too long .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] and there will be a lot of rebellion in that
[B] and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place ,
[A] That 's right .
-----
[A] That ,
[B] I do n't think that they 're going to be serving anybody .
[A] that would be the problem . Sure would .
[B] Yeah .
[B] So I think it would be a good thing though ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] to encourage other people who are n't even aware that they can do such a thing .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] to get out there and do so .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] or maybe offer them , you know , some sort of an incentive to do it .
[B] Yeah .
-----
[A] Uh , you know college credit , you know , something , you know ,
[B] Right .
[A] I 'm not sure what
[A] but ,
[B] Right .
[B] College credit is a good idea because ,
[A] I 'm not sure they need to be , you know , paid , you know ,
[A] a super do salary of any kind .
[B] Right .
[A] but that , that kind of takes away from public service .
[B] That 's right .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] they probably could n't do anything monetary ,
[B] but I think , giving ,
[A] But , just , you know , to receive a letter in the mail ,
[B] giving some kind of college credit ,
[A] that says , you know , you need to report somewhere by next Monday , you know you need to report somewhere by next Monday , you know .
[A] I 'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea .
[B] No ,
-----
[B] I do n't think so either because a lot of people , um , depending on how the public service programs are set up
[B] and I 'm not that familiar with them to know ,
[A] I 'm not either really .
[B] But , you know , if , a , a lot of people flat ca n't afford to .
[A] That 's right .
[B] You know ,
[A] That 's right .
[B] and most kids these days have gotten themselves into , uh , financial situations ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] where they have to be working all the time .
[A] That 's right .
[A] Absolutely .
[A] They need , you- ,
[B] So , it 's , it 's a really tough question .
-----
[A] young families , whatever ,
[B] That 's right .
[A] they just could n't , you know , take off to do that .
[B] Yeah ,
[A] Oh ,
[B] and , if you put them in public service right out of high school , then that , that postpones their college ,
[A] That 's right ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] for a year
[B] and that would upset a lot of people too ,
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] it sure would .
[B] because they just want to get on ,
[A] It would have to be a lot of , you know , thought given to something like that , I would think .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I , you know , I think it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program ,
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] but I , I think it ca n't be something that 's mandatory .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Yeah .
[B] it has to be something that 's voluntary . You know , which is pretty much the way it is now .
[B] They might ,
[A] That 's right .
[A] I 'm not even really sure at this point in time , you know , what , what programs are out there .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] and that 's the other thing is that , you know , instead of making it mandatory , they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better .
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] and , uh , you know , go to the schools and do programs ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and tell them that we need your help , and ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] you know , uh , volunteer for such and such a time ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and you 've a choice of where you want to go .
[A] Yeah .
[B] and , and that way , handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] like maybe if , if there was something they could do in their own , own , in their own town or city ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] in their own community ,
[B] right .
[A] yeah , and not have to pull up roots and , you know , go somewhere half way around the world , or something .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's true .
[B] Most of them probably would n't do something like that .
[A] That 's right .
[B] Although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's , that 's true too .
[A] That 's true too .
[B] But , they would have to be supported in some way ,
-----
[B] and I 'm not sure that tho- , those programs are available to do that .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah .
[A] Me neither .
[A] And , you wonder , you know , what kind of quality job would they do , you know ,
[B] Right .
[A] Just sit around for their year ,
[A] or would they really , you know , make a contribution of some kind .
[B] Right ,
[B] exactly .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it 's tough .
[A] It 's tough .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it is tough .
[B] It 's ,
[B] and I do n't know who 's even proposing it ,
[A] Yeah .
-----
[B] or , or how they plan on implementing it ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] if they do .
[A] I , I 'm not sure either .
[A] But , I think , there would have to be a lot more , you know , information , you know , disseminated , before you say ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] let 's do this , you know .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I think going to the schools would be the easiest for them .
[A] Yeah .
[B] You know , it be ,
[B] it would n't take up much , much , it would take up more time than anything
[B] but it would n't take up a lot of money .
[A] Yeah .
[B] They would n't have to spend money advertising and things like that .
[A] Yeah .
[A] That 's right .
[B] You go to school
[B] and you have a kind of a captive audience ,
[B] get them all in the auditorium ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] and you , you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and , I think , that they could get some results from that ,
[A] Right .
[B] because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded ,
[B] but they do n't know where to go to , to ,
[A] That 's right .
[B] to do anything .
[A] Yeah .
[A] That 's a real waste too .
[A] It really is .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it is .
[B] It really is .
[A] I do n't really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps , like we , you know , we saw back , I guess , in the Carter administration ,
[B] Right .
[A] that was , that was a big thing with him .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] And , I guess even back to Kennedy , as a matter of fact , I guess Kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing , or was , you know , really interested in things like that .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] I just do n't hear much about it anymore .
[A] Like I say , I do n't even know what programs are , are even ongoing now , you know .
[B] I do n't either .
[B] That 's one ,
[A] Anyway , it 's a tough question .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it is a tough question .
[A] Okay ,
[A] well thanks for your time .
[A] I enjoyed talking to you .
[B] Sure ,
[B] same here .
[A] Okay ,
[A] take care .
[B] Ta- , you too .
[A] Bye-bye .
[B] Bye .
