[A] Okay .
[A] Where to start .
[B] I have n't had that much , of course
[B] I just heard ,
[B] but I have n't had that much time to think about it , either .
[B] I guess the , uh , biggest thing I f , find is the financial --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- aspects , uh , particularly , the ability of people to access , you know , your financial records or , for example your credit , uh , rating --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- almost at will .
[A] That 's true .
[A] I did n't think about that .
[B] And , uh , of course flying , uh ,
[B] using your Social Security number , of course , permits people to do that --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and almost anything you do now , a Social Security number is required .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , uh , of course there 's another aspect of this , too , uh , in terms of invasion of privacy
[B] I just thought about it ,
[B] being a professional and , of course , you probably belong to one or more professional organizations ,
[B] and that is that
[B] some of the organizations sell their mailing lists --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- which I think is a , is an invasion of privacy .
[A] I agree .
[A] Yes ,
[A] I get some of these things in the mail that I wonder , where in the world did they get my address or where did they get my name .
[A] And in fact , some of these things I get , some of these questionnaires ,
[A] it 's funny because I 'm , I was in the process of filling one out when I decided I would make this phone call ,
[A] but , uh , I have n't got to the end of it yet where it asks all that salary information and everything ,
[A] but , when you have to send that back in the mail with your name on it , your salary information , I , I just have a real hard time doing that , uh ,
[A] and they ask you what type of household items do you own , like stereos and T V -s and V C R -s
[A] and , and you hate to send something off with your name and address
[A] and what types of things do you own
[A] and what kind of money do you make
[A] and you wonder , well , who 's going to get ahold of this and think , um , that 's a nice place to go rob .
[B] And not only that , it , it opens you to phone solicitations --
[A] Right .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- for a variety of things from ,
[A] I got one tonight about six thirty when I sat down to eat dinner ,
[A] carpet cleaning .
[B] I 've had them for carpet cleaning ,
[B] I 've had them for , of course , for , you know , real estate investments --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- you know , you get , uh , please send in your , uh , you know , this particular card and you get , uh , a free trip or something along those lines .
[A] Right .
[B] And so , that , uh , that bothers me because I , of course , I enjoy being at home and I do not enjoy getting called by strangers --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- uh , particularly solicit , you know , soliciting .
[B] So , g- , having your ,
[B] and I know that a lot of these , of course , are random phone calls --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- they just , you know , start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers ,
[B] but some of them are sold ,
[B] and I know you
[B] talking about mailing lists , the ,
[B] I ,
[B] there is one particular group to which I belong
[B] and for some ,
[B] the reason they have three different names --
[A] Um .
[B] -- for me .
[B] Now the address is the same --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- you know , my , my office address .
[B] But they have one under , you know , my first name , James .
[B] They have one under my first name and initial --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- middle initial ,
[B] then they have a , a third one under my , just my two initials .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And , and I get mail --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- here at home under each of those names .
[A] Oh , no .
[B] So I know that they have sold their mailing list .
[A] Right .
[B] And , uh , I think those two things bother me more than anything else --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- as far as an invasion of privacy .
[B] And , uh , I ca n't really think of anything else offhand , that , uh ,
[A] I think I dislike the phone number part the worst .
[A] I mean , it 's , it 's one thing to get junk mail because you can , you can just put it right in the trash ,
[A] but it 's the phone calls ,
[A] and , you know , usually when they call you , it 's going to be when you s , right when you sit down to dinner because they know , they pretty much know that you 're at work all day
[A] and they call you right when , when you 've just gotten home from work .
[A] The last thing you want is a phone call unless it 's , you know , something halfway enjoyable ,
[A] but if it 's a salesperson , it 's just something you do n't want to have to mess with .
[A] And , and I 've gotten a lot of them lately ,
[A] or I 'll ,
[A] sometimes I come home from work
[A] and there 's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine
[A] and I 'm just assuming it 's probably a salesman that called during the day
[A] and , I was n't home ,
[A] and they 'll probably call me up and , you know , call me back and bother me when I sit down to dinner later on ,
[A] but --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- I find that very annoying . The , uh , mail stuff ,
[A] yeah , you know ,
[A] it 's kind of irritating ,
[A] but it 's not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls .
[B] I think , I think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner ,
[B] I know when I sit down with the family and want to have the opportunity , you know , to talk --
[B] -- and see what 's going on and all those things ,
[B] even if friends call --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- it irritates me .
[A] Yeah .
[B] So I try to ,
[B] I actually during that period of time from , you know , usually from six o'clock or six thirty , whenever I get home , until eight or so , I will shut off the phone --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and , uh , my daughter gets irate ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] when I , when I do that because , you know , she 's a teenager --
[A] Uh , oh .
[B] -- so she 'll , you know ,
[B] I might get an important phone call ,
[B] but ,
[B] So tho- , I guess those three things are the , uh , uh , most irritating to me .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] I agree with the phone , too , in that , I 'm single ,
[A] but when I come home from work , there 's times I need to pay bills ,
[A] I need to balance my checking account ,
[A] I need to do all kinds of different things like that ,
[A] and even though it 's friends calling , sometimes you just feel like , this is my quiet time ,
[A] I need to get things done
[A] and the phone ringing bothers me ,
[A] but that 's , that 's where answering machines are nice , because if it 's really important they 'll leave a message
[A] and I can call them back .
[B] That 's right .
[A] But , uh , at work I have so many phone calls from customers calling in ,
[A] sometimes it is just , I just want to get away from the phone ringing because it , it really does annoy me .
[A] And , uh , if I 've had a lot of phone calls during the day when occasionally when we have , uh ,
[A] like this past week ,
[A] we have to do a lot of troubleshooting when the programmers have installed a new system ,
[A] and , uh , phone rings like crazy
[A] and you come home
[A] and the last thing you want to do is have to answer the phone .
[A] And if it 's some salesman , that just makes it even that much worse .
[A] And , uh , it just ,
[A] I get to where I , I turn the answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone ,
[A] but now with this thing I 'm participating in , I kind of have to answer it , because you never know if it 's the switchboard or if it 's , uh , you know , somebody calling that you really do n't want to talk on the phone .
[B] Well I have , now we have a , you know , voice mail system at , uh , at the office .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Now what I have done is , I have forwarded my home phone --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- to the answering service at the office --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- so that I do not have to have a , uh --
[A] A ring at all .
[B] -- a ring at all .
[A] Oh , huh .
[A] That 's an idea .
[B] If I , if I want to do that .
[A] Right .
[B] And , uh , or I will just let the phone ring three or four times and know that it will forward to , uh , to the office .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And so it 's , you know , it makes it convenient .
[B] But at the office when I , you know ,
[B] we can , uh , on our system , and I imagine on most systems you can just route it directly to the answering service .
[A] Yeah .
[A] Ours is that way , too .
[B] And when I , when I want to be , you know , not bothered during the day , that 's exactly what I do .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And so , uh ,
[A] Well , yours is probably the same as ours .
[A] It 's , uh , Tigon
[A] is n't Tigon , uh , part of G T E or vice versa or something like that .
[B] Uh .
[A] Seems I read ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] well Tigon is part of G T E .
[A] Okay .
[A] Okay
[A] that 's it ,
[A] that G T E had purchased Tigon
[A] and ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's what we have .
[B] Except we call it Aspen .
[A] Aspen ?
[B] Yes .
[A] Huh .
[B] And , uh , we ,
[A] I could n't remember in Tigon had purchased G T E -s phone mail services or if G T E had purchased Tigon .
[A] I knew there was some type of a tie in there .
[A] I remember reading in the paper a few months back
[A] but ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] G T E purchased Tigon .
[A] Okay .
[B] And so , we had , had been using a , the Aspen service before they purchased Tigon --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- so I imagine we will be , uh , shifting over to that service --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- uh , for a while , or if , in a while .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] As soon as we determine what we 're going to do with Contel after we bought Contel .
[A] Oh , no .
[B] Yeah .
[B] Oh , Dana , I think we have probably conversed long enough .
[A] I think we did ,
[B] Well ,
[A] that 's good .
[B] All right .
[A] I did n't think we could go too far on this privacy thing ,
[A] but , uh ,
[A] I guess it 's close enough .
[B] well thank you for calling .
[B] I ha- , I ,
[A] Sure , good talking to you , Jim .
[B] I enjoyed talking to you .
[A] All right .
[A] Bye-bye .
[B] Take care .
