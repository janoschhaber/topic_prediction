[A] Okay ,
[A] what kind of hobbies do you have ?
[B] Um , mostly what I do ,
[B] I do do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing ,
[B] and then I , I read a lot .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] I like to read , too .
[A] I was trying to think of some while , while it was , uh , talking about it ,
[A] and then I ,
[A] it took so long for someone to answer ,
[A] I started reading the --
[B] Oh .
[A] -- newspaper , and kind of forgot about it .
[A] But , uh , yeah ,
[A] I 'd say reading is probably one of my biggest ones , because it 's the type of thing that you can , you can do a little bit at a time , whereas , I would love to do crafts and stuff if I just had the time to do it --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- or if I had the space .
[A] I live in a pretty small apartment ,
[A] and , uh , I would have to , you know , put stuff away .
[A] I have two cats ,
[A] so I could n't really leave it out if I was working on something .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Reading is a little bit easier to work around .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] you can pick it up and take it wherever you go .
[A] That 's right .
[B] MUMBLEx any MUMBLEx space .
[B] I get too involved in reading sometimes that I neglect what I should be doing .
[A] That 's true ,
[A] I do the same thing .
[B] You get so involved in what you 're reading .
[A] What types of crafts do you do ?
[B] I do a little bit of woodworking ,
[B] well , I used to .
[B] I do n't have the equipment here .
[B] We moved to Dallas about a year ago --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and I did some of that . Um ,
[B] here I 've mostly done things that I can do strictly by hand , um , sewing and quilting and , um ,
[B] what else have I done ?
[B] Things to hang on the wall .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Mostly just stuff that I can , you know , use right around the house --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- or give away as gifts .
[A] Right .
[B] I 've been making a lot of quilts , well , not a lot , but several quilts lately .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] So .
[A] I enjoy , uh , sewing and needlework also .
[A] I 've , I 've , uh , made some small things , cross stitch things .
[A] And , um --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- back when I was in high school , I worked at a needlework shop ,
[A] and I , I used to do the latch hook rugs and needlepoint and things like that ,
[A] and I , I still remember how to do it .
[A] It 's just been so long since I 've actually sat down and taken the time to do something like that .
[A] But I have recently done some cross stitch .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And I enjoy doing that .
[A] It 's just the same old thing ,
[A] it 's just getting the time to do it .
[B] Yeah .
[B] I 've done some cross , um , cross stitch ,
[B] but I never count right ,
[B] and I always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- or , or something .
[B] It never has worked out completely .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it takes a lot of concentration .
[A] I mean , it was the type of thing ,
[A] I was , I was making some little things for Christmas ,
[A] and I also made a little thing for a baby gift ,
[A] and , uh , I thought , Oh , I can do this while I watch T V .
[A] Wrong .
[B] Right .
[A] No ,
[A] you must pay all attention to what you 're doing .
[A] It 's , it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be .
[A] It took me , uh , quite a bit of time .
[A] I though , Oh , this wo n't take long at all .
[A] But --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- I was wrong .
[A] It took , it took a while to do .
[A] But , it was fun ,
[A] I enjoyed it .
[B] Yeah .
[B] The first project I started out one was a big one ,
[B] it was , uh , it was of a lady
[B] and she was kneeling ,
[B] and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe .
[A] Oh my gosh .
[B] And I ,
[B] it was just too much to start with .
[B] And I still have n't finished it , because I , I stopped ,
[B] and I thought I better do some simple things and work up to this --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- because it was just so difficult --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- to get it done .
[B] And there were so many different shadings and colors ,
[B] and , and , it was just too much to begin with .
[B] And I think kind of discouraged me from doing much more with it .
[A] Yeah .
[A] That 's pretty understandable .
[B] And I 've done some of the crewel and the , um --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- something similar to that
[B] but it does n't have the specific stitches .
[B] Anyway , it 's a little bit more loose , and not quite as structured ,
[B] and I like that a little bit better --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- the variety of stitches and stuff in that .
[B] More like embroidery or something .
[A] I 'm trying to think of anything else I do as a hobby . Um . I do n't even watch T V very much .
[A] I was tonight ,
[A] but ,
[B] Yeah .
[B] I was reading when you called .
[A] Yeah .
[B] How about movies ,
[B] do you like to go to movies ?
[A] Yeah
[A] I do , I do like to go to movies ,
[A] and I have a V C R ,
[A] so I like to rent movies ,
[A] and , um , I have , right now I have the movie channel ,
[A] so I 've recorded quite a few movies off of that . Um ,
[A] just , I 've kind of got a collection going of tapes now ,
[A] and whenever I go visit my parents , they 're always saying , Well , bring some of your tapes .
[A] They always borrow a few of them .
[A] I was over there ,
[A] they live in Duncanville --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and I was over there at Easter ,
[A] and they said , Bring some tapes with you .
[A] So they are always borrowing my tapes .
[B] Yeah .
[A] But , uh ,
[B] Well we ,
[A] I like to , I like to do , uh , stuff with plants .
[A] I like , um , I have a lot of plants in my apartment ,
[A] and I 've got a pretty small porch ,
[A] but it 's , it 's , uh ,
[A] I 've got a few planters out there that I , I 'll , uh , you know ,
[A] in the winter time I usually plant some pansies in there ,
[A] and then in the summer I 'll plant petunias ,
[A] or something that 's colorful
[A] and like , that blooms a lot .
[A] But --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- have n't done that yet .
[A] I kept thinking that it was going to get cold one more time ,
[A] but I think we 're probably past that now .
[A] I probably should go buy some .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I guess if I had a house I might enjoy gardening , some .
[A] I 'm not real crazy about pulling weeds and things like that .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it 's the hard work .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I like the planting , and watering is okay .
[B] It 's so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers ,
[B] it 's so beau ,
[B] I mean , we do n't .
[B] We live in an apartment also .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I 've got a few plants here ,
[B] but I 'm not really knowledgeable .
[B] I feel real good if I water them
[B] and they continue to grow .
[B] You know , I feel like , Oh , I 've accomplished something .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] So I enjoy it ,
[B] but I 'm just not experienced enough with
[A] Yeah .
[A] I do n't know too much about it either .
[A] Mine 's pretty limited to my little , uh , porch plants .
[A] And then the ones in my apartment , half of which do n't look real healthy ,
[A] but I do n't always get direct sun except in certain spots .
[B] Oh , yeah .
[A] And so that 's probably my problem there .
[A] But ,
[B] Have you tried any , growing any , um , like fruits and vegetables or anything ?
[B] I guess vegetables are in , insi- , like in pots and stuff ?
[A] No ,
[A] I never have tried that , just because I do n't have that much space on this little porch here in this apartment --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- or this little balcony .
[A] And my other two pots are ,
[A] they 're kind of , they 're pretty big ,
[A] and I have enough plants in them that it takes up a lot of my porch area ,
[A] so between that and the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood ,
[A] there 's no room for much else .
[A] But my dad , uh , my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house .
[A] And I 'd , I think when I was real little I probably had a finger in on that every time he did it --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and had to be out there and watch and that type of stuff .
[A] But I 've never really tried anything like that since then .
[B] Well , I considered it last year
[B] and this year both ,
[B] but I have n't done anything about it .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] So . I think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch .
[B] We get lots of sunlight here ,
[B] and the porch is screened in
[B] and it 's pretty large .
[A] Oh , wow .
[B] So , um , I think if I just would be ,
[B] if I 'd do something , be motivated enough to do something , I think it would work out well .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But , but there goes that motivation thing again .
[A] Right .
[A] Well , I enjoy playing with my cats .
[A] I do n't know if you 'd call that a hobby ,
[A] but I have two cats ,
[A] and I gave them a bath tonight ,
[A] so they 're a little bit angry at me .
[B] MUMBLEx . Can you --
[A] They did n't like it too much .
[B] -- can you put them right in the water ?
[A] Yeah ,
[A] oh yeah --
[B] Oh , that 's good ,
[A] -- right in the tub ,
[A] and it helps because it 's the time of the year that they 're shedding a lot , and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine .
[A] So I thought ,
[A] this 'll help , you know , help them shed ,
[A] and sure enough , boy the fur just came off like crazy once I got them --
[B] Oh , yeah .
[A] -- in the tub .
[A] So , they 're pretty content now ,
[A] but they were mad at me for quite a while .
[A] They went and hid after they , after they got dried off .
[B] Sulked for a while , huh .
[A] Yeah .
[B] Well , I like animals ,
[B] but we do n't have any yet .
[B] We have a nine month old with another on the way --
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- and we thought , well maybe when they 're a little bit bigger --
[A] Yeah .
[B] -- then we 'll ,
[B] or get into a house with a little more space .
[B] I 'd love to have , have some animals .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] But I like dogs
[B] and my husband likes cats .
[B] So we have n't reached a real agreement on that yet .
[B] If we get a place where we can have both , it 'll be great ,
[B] but until then ,
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I like both ,
[A] but since I 'm in an apartment , I just , I do n't think an apartment is big enough for a dog .
[A] Dogs , to me , dogs need a yard , even little dogs .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] They just need a yard .
[A] Cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine .
[A] But I just think dogs need , need to be outside , though .
[A] So ,
[B] I agree with you .
[B] I ,
[B] if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat , or even a bird or a fish tank or something , you know .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] now that 's an idea --
[B] Something small --
[A] -- with the small babies .
[B] -- that she can watch , but wo n't take too much care .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] because , you kind of ,
[A] even , even a cat , you never know when they might bite or scratch or something .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] They 're not as likely to as a dog might , I guess .
[A] But with little ones , I 'd be kind of scared , to get anything that has teeth or claws .
[B] Especially when they 're not quite to the age of understanding that they 're hurting , you know ,
[B] that
[B] they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk .
[A] Oh yeah .
[B] And if I was a cat or dog , I 'd respond probably by biting or something .
[B] I do n't know .
[A] Oh , yeah .
[B] That 'd be my self defense .
[B] But ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] Well , I think we probably reached our time limit .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] probably
[A] so , and I 'm out of , out of good ideas for a hobby anyway .
[B] Oh , okay .
[A] Well it was good talking to you .
[B] Thank you for calling .
[A] All right .
[A] Bye-bye .
[B] Bye-bye .
