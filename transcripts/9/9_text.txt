[A] Okay , um ,
[A] I do n't know about you
[A] but where I am we have a like an extremely lax dress policy at work
[A] and it varies like every day . I mean from jeans one day to business suits the next .
[B] 
[A] It 's pretty bad ,
[A] but it 's true , you know ,
[A] they tend to try to be , you know , real lax
[A] and supposedly the policy is like , you know , we , you know , we , hire these wonderful creative people
[A] and we do n't want to smush their creativity , you know .
[A] We want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want .
[A] And , you know , you really will see people in in jeans one day and business suits the next .
[B] Well , I 'm kind of that way too .
[B] I work in the legal department
[B] and where we are now , what we 're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And I get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day ,
[B] it always seems like I 'm doing that
[B] and I ca n't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry , you know , boxes of documents around ,
[B] so , if I 'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing , you know , odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents , I dress down .
[B] But if we 're going to have a meeting , where we 're having the attorneys come in , or people from , uh , other party 's attorneys and stuff , then I normally dress up .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] and I 'll wear a dress and hose and stuff .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] you know , we 're kind of that way too .
[A] I try to ,
[A] I 'm the same way you are ,
[A] I kind of try to judge from day to day .
[A] I know , you know , where I am we work a lot with the customers
[A] and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time
[A] and ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and , you know , if I know that they 're going to be there , you know , you , I try to really watch it and like you say , you know , really dress up
[A] and if I know they 're not , you know ,
[A] I , I 've been doing a lot of reorganization , you know , the last couple of months the same way you are , you know ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and it 's just MUMBLEx , it 's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress .
[B] That 's right ,
[B] that 's right .
[A] It is
[A] and so ,
[B] As a matter of fact , I thought I had one funny story
[B] when , uh , I was at T I the first year or so , we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes .
[B] We had them in the warehouse ,
[A] Uh .
[B] and at that point , it , the warehouse was over across the road
[B] and it was n't air conditioned ,
[B] and , it , we were there like in the middle of the summer ,
[B] it 's unair-conditioned ,
[B] it was dusty and dirty , uh ,
[B] there was like a fan at the very end of the row
[B] and that was it .
[B] And so , we did n't really know we were n't supposed to ,
[B] we thought T I dress code was just dress appropriate to your job ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] we wore shorts .
[B] We did n't know that was a big no , no .
[A] Oh no .
[B] And the supervisor from another area came up to us
[B] and , you know , this area where record retention is , there 's only a few people that work there ,
[B] and he , sho- , he knew who worked there ,
[B] he should have realized that we were n't regulars in the warehouse there .
[B] And he came up to us
[B] and he just said , who 's your supervisor .
[B] Well he called our supervisor and our supervisor , and our supervisor 's supervisor ,
[B] and it went up all the way to the head of facilities ,
[A] Oh no .
[B] complaining that we were wearing shorts .
[B] He did n't at , at least say to us , did you know you 're not supposed to do that .
[B] That could have alleviated a big problem .
[B] We ended up getting called out on it .
[A] Oh , how awful .
[A] It sounds like Mister Power Hungry .
[B] Yeah .
[A] You know , just yesterday , though , I saw a girl in the spine out here at Lewisville that had on a pair of shorts .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] And I do n't care ,
[A] you can call them split skirts
[A] and you can call them culottes all you want
[A] but these were shorts .
[A] That 's all they were .
[B] 
[A] I do n't care what else you call them , you know ,
[A] if they 're below the knee , okay ,
[A] maybe you can call them split skirts .
[A] If they 're above the knee they turn into shorts , you know .
[B] 
[A] And these were n't even really full ones .
[A] I mean they had a problem out here with it last summer , wearing these shorts that were , you know , the real wide full ones , you know ,
[A] and becau- , these were n't even those .
[A] These were like pretty short , black ,
[A] and they were very dressy ,
[A] the were black velvet shorts
[A] and she had on black hose and black heels
[A] and she looked very , very nice .
[B] Um .
[A] But , you do n't wear shorts to work .
[A] You know , I mean , MUMBLEx as far as I 'm considered , she was in violation
[A] and nobody says anything to them .
[A] It 's always been a big problem in Lewisville in the summertime .
[B] Um .
[A] You know , if they just , you know ,
[A] the management does n't ever seem to want to take an , cut off , you know , that no ,
[A] this is wear we 're going to draw the line .
[A] This is shorts , you know .
[B] Yeah .
[A] And , and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that , you know ,
[B] Um .
[A] so , it always gets annoying because the rest of us are going , well God , we have a pair of those at home too .
[A] It sure would be cool and comfortable to wear , you know ,
[A] but .
[B] Well I 've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the TexTeller machine .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And they have said no .
[A] Yeah
[A] and then during the week you see these women , in the you know ,
[A] just because you put on a pair of hose with them does n't make them not shorts anymore , you know .
[B] Yeah .
[A] I mean I 've never seen them do it without hose ,
[A] I mean they always have hose on ,
[A] but still , it 's , they 're shorts ,
[A] I do n't care what you say ,
[A] they 're shorts .
[B] 
[A] Well I think T I 's dress code is pretty lax considering everything , anyway , you know , uh .
[B] I know , I did n't know that E D S has a very strict dress code ,
[B] I had a friend ,
[A] Oh do they really ?
[B] Oh definitely .
[B] I had a friend who worked there for a year or so
[B] and they spell it out .
[B] For men it 's particular suits , uh , the pin stripe , and the particular colors of shirts and win- , wing tipped shoes .
[A] Oh , my God .
[B] Oh , it is definitely lined out .
[B] Women are not allowed to wear slacks ,
[B] you wear coordinated suits .
[A] I coul , I could n't afford to work there .
[B] And , and a particular kind of shoe , you know , so high heel ,
[B] oh it is spelled out .
[A] Oh , no .
[B] When I was looking at her materials when she first started , you know , she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] And it told about the dress code
[B] and it said , these are the color pastel shirts you may wear , or white shirts with this kind of stripe in it for the men and this kind of shoe and , hair just this way .
[A] T I -s says no shorts and no halters .
[A] I know , that 's it .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] and E D S is very particular about this , hair cuts ,
[A] Wow .
[B] I mean it was like you ca n't have , you know , such and such facial hair , no beards , you know , and just really detailed .
[A] I do n't know that that would be a good environment to work in .
[A] I mean , I see ,
[A] I , I am more ,
[A] I do n't know about anybody else ,
[A] and a lot of bosses may say I 'm nuts ,
[A] but I am more productive when I 'm in pants .
[B] 
[A] I , I am .
[A] I work faster ,
[A] I get things done faster , than when I 'm in a dress and heels , you know ,
[A] I ,
[A] and it 's weird
[A] but I , it 's I do , I can , I can get so much more done if I 'm dressed comfortable , you know .
[B] Well the , the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had , uh , another person coming from Washington , our outside counsel .
[B] And she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse
[B] but she really did n't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse , but the warehouse .
[A] Right .
[B] And she came with skirts , just like she 'd be going into the office .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And we 'd try , we 'd try to say , did n't you bring any pants or anything .
[B] We 're , we 're out here in the warehouse , you know ,
[B] you , you got your skid of , you know , that wooden pallet of boxes .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and you 're going to have un , unload you skid look at the documents in the , in the boxes and then repack your skid .
[B] And she ,
[A] You ca n't do that in a skirt poor soul .
[B] And she was so , she was so hot and miserable , you know , in the skirt .
[A] Oh yuck .
[B] She finally tried to go buy , you know , a pair of pants
[B] but , you know , I mean it was just completely miserable for her .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's terrible ,
[A] that 's terrible
[A] gosh .
[B] 
[A] Well I do n't know ,
[A] I just figure , you know , yeah ,
[A] sometimes I worry about , you know , if I go in in pants ,
[A] and I never , I never ever , ever , ever go in in a pair of jeans , you know .
[A] But I 'll go in in pants .
[A] I mean today I had on a pair of , you know , navy blue dress slacks and , and , uh , like a peach colored top and , you know , not cruddy , but not a dress either .
[A] And sometimes I wonder if stuff like that would , will hold you back , you know , if you do n't dress in , you know , your dress for success business suits everyday if , you know , if upper management does n't notice that and remember that later on ,
[A] but , you know , I do n't know if they do or not .
[A] You know , I see a lot of the managers
[A] and they 're in jeans ,
[A] so , you know .
[B] Some of our people in the legal department ,
[B] we have , um , assistants to the general counsel
[B] and it 's funny
[B] because , there 's one that always wears a suit .
[B] A matter of fact , he 's never seen without his jacket to the suit on , buttoned .
[A] Really , wow .
[B] And then there 's another one who 's , who 's a little younger and a little more yuppish
[B] and he 's always kind of like in the khaki pants and , you know , a shirt ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and sometimes he wears the jacket to it .
[A] Yeah .
[B] And some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes
[B] and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt .
[B] So that 's just ,
[A] Is n't that funny .
[B] With the , you know , the little suspenders or something on
[B] so .
[A] That 's great .
[B] We 've , we 've kind of had a variety there
[B] but , I think a lot of times it 's , it 's mainly who they 're going to meet with ,
[B] or they 're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that 's how they are .
[A] Yeah .
[B] If they 're just going to be meeting with T I -ers like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the , they 're engineers that they 're talking too , they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed
[B] and they 're usually casual .
[A] That 's the way to do it . I mean that 's the smart way to do it .
[B] Yeah .
[A] It really is , because you 're making , you know ,
[A] if when they 're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down , if they come in , in , you know , a six hundred dollar three piece suit , it 's going to make the people they 're meeting with feel very uncomfortable , you know ,
[A] or it would me , you know .
[B] It 's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] yeah ,
[A] look at this slick guy ,
[A] I wonder what kind of money does he make ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] 
[A] I can see it now .
[A] Well it was good to talk to you .
[A] It was really enjoyable .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] this is , this is kind of a fun project .
[A] It really is .
[B] I 've done some of the other speech programs ,
[B] but we 've never got to talk to another person ,
[B] it was always just talking to the computer .
[A] Oh , yuck ,
[A] yeah .
[B] So this is a little different .
[A] Well it 's kind of enjoyable ,
[A] I 'm really looking forward to it .
[B] Yeah .
[A] Well thanks a lot .
[B] Okay ,
[B] bye .
[A] Bye-bye .
