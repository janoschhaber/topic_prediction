[A] Uh , books .
[B] Yes .
[A] Mainly I read the Bible these days .
[B] That 's very good .
[B] I do , too .
[A] Good , that 's great to hear .
[A] Uh , and Christian literature .
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] Uh , I 've kind of ,
[A] I used to read a lot of , uh , novels ,
[A] but it seems as though if you really want to set a t- , side time to read the Bible and you work and --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and whatever , uh , that pretty well takes up your time for reading .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] it does .
[B] It ,
[A] And I , I been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible in my heart
-----
[A] and he really has .
[A] It 's getting ,
[B] That 's good .
[A] to where a just really want to read it .
[B] That 's good .
[B] It , it , it 's , uh , it 's hard for me to find time , also , to read .
[B] Uh , a lot of times I do just read magazines and stuff like that for , you know , because I do n't have a lot of time ,
[B] but when I do get to sit down and , and read , I like to read the Bible
[B] and I like to read ,
[B] I read to my daughter a lot , too .
[A] Do you ?
-----
[B] And , uh , I like to read , you know , Bi- ,
[B] I have Bible storybooks --
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] uh-huh .
[B] -- so I like reading those to her
[B] and she really enjoys those .
[B] So that 's good .
[B] And it , and it 's kind of short because we do n't , woe do n't have a lot of time ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] to , to read ,
[B] so , it 's real enjoyable .
[A] Yeah .
[B] For both of us .
[A] Have you ever read any of Frank E Peretti 's ?
[B] Frank E
[B] no
[B] I guess I have n't .
[A] Uh , THIS PRESENT DARKNESS and , uh , uh , I forget the t- , the other ,
[A] well he , uh , he 's also written a lot of children ,
[A] how old is your daughter .
[B] Five .
[A] Five ,
[A] okay ,
[A] he 's written some children 's books as well
[A] and they 're all spiritually ,
[B] Oh , really ?
-----
[A] uh , oriented ,
[A] yeah .
[B] What 's his name again ?
[B] Peretti ,
[A] Frank E Peretti ,
[B] Frank E Peretti .
[A] P E R E T T I .
[B] I have to look for those .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] do
[A] because , uh , I love to read his , his , uh , children 's books just ,
[B] Just to read them .
[B] Well , that 's good .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] oh , they 're good ,
[A] they 're great .
[B] That 's good .
[A] And it 's like , uh , uh , usually about a family of , uh , archaeologists --
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] -- and the spiritual fights that they get into ,
[B] Oh .
[A] like , uh , uh , digging in old ruins ,
[B] Yeah .
[A] and running across , like , uh , the old gods and things .
[B] Oh , that sounds pretty neat .
-----
[A] Yeah ,
[A] it is .
[A] It 's real exciting .
[B] Oh , I 'll have to look for those .
[A] And it also teaches them spiritual warfare --
[B] Right .
[A] -- you know ,
[A] so ,
[B] Well , that 's neat .
[B] Well , I , I have a ,
[B] my daughter has PRECIOUS MOMENTS collection --
[A] Uh-huh .
-----
[B] -- and I like that because it 's a , it 's real easy to , uh , follow for her ,
[B] you know , uh , gosh , if , if I read straight out of the Bible to her she 'd never understand any of it .
[A] Well , it 's hard for me .
[B] That 's right .
[B] It is , it is real hard to , to follow and understand ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] and , uh , I 've got a Bible that , uh , has a little bit of a , uh , a glossary in the back
[B] and it helps explain who people are .
[B] That 's , that 's about the hardest thing is , who 's related to who .
[A] I know it ,
[A] and especially it 's hard to keep your interest --
[B] Yeah .
[A] -- in those begats .
[B] Yes .
[B] Yes ,
[B] it sure is ,
[B] but , but it is good reading
[B] and it 's good for us ,
[A] Uh-huh ,
[A] that 's right .
[B] and and everything .
[B] I really do enjoy it .

[A] Uh-huh .
[B] -- in there .
[B] I 've never read any of his .
[B] But they 're real ,
[A] I kind of got burnt out on Steven King , though .

[A] it 's one of his first books , THE STAND .
[B] Yes .
[B] That , oh , that long thing .
[A] I know it .

[A] Oh , those hedges when they started moving .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] Whenever they , they made that into a movie , I was thinking oh , my gosh if they show that ,
[A] I 'll just die .

[B] Yeah ,
[B] that is ,
[B] he just brings stuff alive , you know .
[A] Yeah .
[B] You could just visualize everything .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] That 's ,
[A] And that was a pretty scary movie , too .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] I think they did a pretty good job ,
[B] but ,
[A] Yeah .
[B] they did n't follow it exactly ,
[B] but they did give it , you know , do it justice .
[A] Uh-huh .
[A] That 's right .
[B] But , uh , most of the time they do n't with , when , follow books very well when they make them into movies .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] that 's true .
[A] I liked IT as well .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah , uh ,
