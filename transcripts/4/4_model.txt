[A] Have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list
-----
[A] and they 're either offering a service
[A] or they 're introducing some new product in the area
[A] and normally when they call , you 're either in the shower ,
[A] or you 're in the middle of cooking something
[A] and you have to stop everything to run to the phone .
[B] Yes ,
[B] yes .
[B] Is , is that one that you 're talking about .
[A] That was the big one I 'm talking about .
[A] I work weird hours ,
[A] and invariably just about the time , I 'm going to sleep , the phone tears off the wall .
-----
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] uh-huh .
[A] And you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone ,
[A] you either hear , the cli- , as soon as you say hello , you hear the click of the recording coming on ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] or you hear somebody all ready starting , reading off a list of stuff that they 've read probably a thousand times that day already .
[B] That 's true ,
[B] or the ones that are , are generated by a computer .
[B] It 's just a computer voice that comes on the line .
[B] Those are the ones that I really , really hate too .
[A] I 've even had some of them ,
-----
[A] the , they 're voice activated
[A] and you 've got to say hello twice before they 'll do anything .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] uh-huh .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] sometimes I , I get them on my , uh , answering machine at home
-----
[B] so , and I hate that when I 've got a whole bunch of messages
[B] and I go through them
[B] and most of them are n't from anybody at all .
[A] What I would love to see done to stop all of this ,
-----
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] we 've got a thing in this country ,
[A] you can have your phone number unlisted ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and I think a law should be passed to where any of these people ,
[A] I think it 's great , that you know , freedom of speech in this country and everything ,
[A] but if they 're going to offer these services , or these recorded message , everything , they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] yes ,
[B] see I have an unlisted telephone number ,
[B] but I still get all of those calls
[B] and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that I do n't even understand .
[B] So , yeah ,
[B] I do ,
[B] I really feel that 's , uh , an invasion of my privacy .
[B] I agree with you on that particular subject there .
[B] Let me see .
[A] That 's about , that as far as any other everyday occurrences ,
[A] I put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door , either religious groups , or people peddling products .
[A] If I wanted their products , I would have either gone to the store to bought it ,
[A] or I would have called for their salesman to come out .
[B] Uh-huh ,
[B] uh-huh .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] that 's true .
[B] Living in an apartment complex though , you know you ca n't , um , you ca n't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations , uh ,
-----
[B] but they still come up to the front door and , uh , you know , walk around .
[B] So , usually what I do is I 'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey , there 's people coming around , you know ,
[B] and they 're trying to sell something
[B] or , or they 're from a religious organization
[B] and I really hate that .
[B] I really , really do .
[B] I had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago
[B] and , uh , gosh it was about nine o'clock at night , too .
[B] It was n't even what I would consider , you know , family hours ,
[B] time to , you know , start going to bed
[B] and uh , and it was somebody from , um , oh what was it , the , uh , Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints ,
[B] and uh , I 've read a lot about , uh , that particular sect
[B] and I do n't particularly care for it ,
[B] so I especially do n't like for them to come up to my door and , and try and talk to me .
[A] Now , I agree with their right to , uh , pursue their religion of choice , in that , whatever manner they want to ,
-----
[A] but I think they should also respect the sanctity of the American home , whether it be in a house or in an apartment .
[A] I 'm on my turf ,
[A] if I want them there , I 'll call for them ,
[A] otherwise , I do n't want to know they exist .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] no ,
[B] I , I agree with you there .
[B] If they want to choose that particular religion that 's fine with me too , you know , as long as they do n't try and pull me in and drag me in .
-----
[B] And , and I do n't like the way that they do it either ,
[B] and , and , it 's their mission that they do it .
[B] They go door to door
[B] and they go out into the public
[B] and they actually have the , uh , teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work
[B] and , uh , I do n't know ,
[B] I just , um , do n't particularly care for that at all .
[B] And that , that 's one thing that I feel really strongly about though , is , uh , you know , people coming up to my door , and especially religious organizations and wanting to uh , you know , to try and get me to join or , you know , become interested in their religion ,
[B] because I have my own .
[A] Now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting ,
[A] I 've even gone so far as to put that ,
[A] I 've got a storm door on the front of the house
[A] and I 've put , in ,
-----
[A] I do n't know how much clearer it can be ,
[A] it 's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting .
[A] I should have , I guess I should make another one that says religious or otherwise , cause I still get ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] that 's true ,
[B] yeah .
[B] No
[B] I do n't , uh , I do n't have , I did n't go that far
[B] but , uh , yeah
[B] I probably could do the same thing , uh , you know ,
[B] I do n't have a storm door ,
[B] but I 'm sure I could rig up something .
[B] But you know I do n't think that that would stop people .
[B] I , it 's like they see that word
[B] and it says go , instead of stop .
[B] Oh , goodness .
[A] and then reverse it ,
[A] and do ,
[A] well that would be technically illegal ,
-----
[A] it would be harassment .
[B] Oh gosh .
[A] But , I consider an invasion of my privacy ,
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah .
[A] a harassment in itself .
[B] Yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] yeah ,
[B] that 's true ,
[B] that 's true , um .
[B] Well what else ?
[A] I believe we 've pretty much summed everything up .
[B] I know ,
[B] but I remember you , you talked about something ,
-----
[B] you started off and said ,
[B] well let me think ,
[B] you talked about the telephone calls and people coming and soliciting and selling things at the door .
[B] You said something else .
[B] I ca n't remember what it was ,
[B] and I thought yeah ,
[B] that , that kind of touched a nerve right there ,
[B] but we got uh , we got to talking about the , uh , uh , people coming to you at the front door .
[A] I 'm drawing a blank .
[B] Oh goodness ,
-----
[B] okay ,
[B] is our five minutes up ?
[A] Uh , pretty close to it .
[B] Pretty close .
[A] Well I 've enjoyed talking with you .
[B] Well it was nice talking to you too Jim .
-----
[A] And take it easy now .
[B] Okay ,
[B] thanks ,
[B] bye .
[A] Good night .
