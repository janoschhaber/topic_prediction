[B] Well , in the norman , in a normal route of way we do things , how about the ladies go first ?
[A] All righty .
[A] Um , well , I , uh , have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year ,
[A] so I 'm really just starting to get involved in , uh , in what 's out there and how they do things .
[A] Um , as far as the system as a whole , I really do n't see a problem with it .
[A] I do see a problem with graduating people that , that ca n't read and are not , you know , productive in society or productive to themselves
[A] and , uh , I think that 's the main problem at this point .
[A] How about yourself ?
[B] All right .
[B] I 'm , live in Plano , Texas
[B] and , uh ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] uh , today we 're not even suppose to be in school because the , uh , the way the taxation and all that crap is , there really legally is n't any funding for the school systems in Texas today .
[A] Right .
[B] So , uh , I mean , when you , when you take , uh , uh , professionals and put them in situations , they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education ,
[B] and they ca n't get their finger out of their ear long enough to , to get that major subject in line ,
[B] something 's wrong .
[B] So , I think here in Texas mainly that the , the , they 're not serious ,
[B] they 're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for what , how the level of education should be for children .
[B] I have a one year old
[B] so I 'm not , I 'm more opinionated about the observations than , than the true facts ,
[B] but ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] it 's just a shame to me that , that the , our firemen , our policemen , and school teachers are the three least paid utilities , um , that have the biggest impact to our well-being .
[A] That 's true .
[B] I have , I have a real issue with that .
[B] Um , I think that if from every year when they , when they pull in the , the , the , uh , test that the last three years , you know , ten , eleven , twelve year , uh , graders take ,
[B] and , and then you see that their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states .
[B] They 're not saying that something 's wrong with the educational system here in Texas ,
[B] I have a real concern about that , um ,
[B] as a matter of fact I 'm very content to spend my daughter out of state to college in Virginia ,
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] uh , verses having her go down here and not learn anything ,
[B] and then , uh , so I 'm , MUMBLEx my opinion I think there 's a big concern
[B] hope , hopefully the new , uh , education , secretary of education will do something to fix the problem
[B] but , uh , I do n't know ,
[B] they 've got to quit worrying about , uh , the , uh , religious , uh , overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] I think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that people , you know , special interest groups can blow up ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] and , uh , and not really get down to teaching what 's important .
[A] Teaching these kids , you know , how MUMBLEx really the basics is what it comes down to .
[B] Exactly .
[B] I was astonished to find out that , that across the United States in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed .
[A] Is that right ?
[B] Ha- , they do n't even , a lot of the school systems do n't even , uh , the kids nowadays do n't even know what , what the president 's fitness education program is all about ,
[A] Huh .
[B] they do n't have to do sit-ups and push-ups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school .
[A] I remember .
[B] And , yeah ,
[B] and , uh , I talked to a thirteen year old last night who 's , uh , goes to , uh , one of the Plano high schools or junior highs , I guess ,
[B] and she said that she had a choice ,
[B] she could either have taken tennis , or weight lifting
[B] so she choice to take weight lifting ,
[B] over the regular gym ,
[B] I mean , give me a break ,
[B] I mean , the kids sit there
[B] and they , and they drink cokes and eat popcorn for , for lunch
[B] and ,
[A] And talk ,
[A] yeah .
[B] then go out there and lift weights and do n't learn anything ,
[B] it 's just a real , I have a real problem with the whole system .
[A] Huh .
[B] They need to put some sternness back into the , into the teachers and let them be able to , uh , get the old whip out and get some discipline .
[A] Yeah ,
[A] then it comes down to what you said before though about them being some of the lowest paid public , you know , public service ,
[B] Uh-huh .
[A] employees that there are ,
[B] I used to ,
[A] and yet they 're so important .
[B] I used to date a girl who taught English at ninth grade level .
[A] Uh-huh .
[B] I mean , I was absolutely flabbergasted at what , they wo- , what she was paid .
[B] True ,
[B] she was young , you know ,
[B] but still it 's the principle .
[A] Right .
[B] Of course , if she got her Master 's degree it would all be different .
[B] But , uh ,
[A] Well , you know , it 's hard though because then you start talking taxes
[A] and ,
[B] Oh , taxes Lord forbi ,
[A] that 's a bad word .
[B] Lord forbid , taxes .
[B] Goodness gracious , if we would , uh , plan our expressways a little better , that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads , we 'd cut that in half and get some teachers we might have us a problem .
[A] There 's an idea .
[B] Maybe I should run for office , huh ? .
[A] Run on that then , no income taxes in Texas , huh ?
[B] That 's true .
[A] I 'm in Texas too ,
[A] so ,
[B] That 's funny ,
[B] that 's funny .
[B] Well , that 's about all I have here .
[A] Well me , too ,
[A] I , uh , I think we both agree there 's some problems there
[A] but ,
[B] ma'am .
[A] we 'll , maybe do our small part to fix them up .
[B] Surely .
[B] I 've enjoyed it .
[A] All right ,
[A] you too .
[B] Bye , bye .
[A] Bye .
